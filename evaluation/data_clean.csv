_art_g_giovanni_frances_nativit.jpg,"This work belongs to a group of mid-fifteenth-century Florentine paintings which could be attributed to Giovanni di Francesco, formerly known as the Master of the Carrand Triptych. It seems too large to have functioned as a predella, for it would not fit below an individual section of a polyptych. However, it could have served as the lower part of a single-field altarpiece.The composition with two scenes depicting the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi is rather sophisticated. The placement of the walls at an angle and the use of this background two divide the two scenes; the alternation of figures in frontal and profile view; and the contrast  of fully lit and penumbral areas attest to a strict spatial logic deployed to create a unified stage setting. The imposing wall is rendered with an obsession for architectural detail and measured by the grid formed by the scaffolding holes. Breaches in the wall enliven the scene by providing views onto the landscape, while elsewhere the wall remains intact and serves as backdrop for the figures. Although this type of background was inspired by Fra Angelico's Adoration of the Magi, its figurative weight anticipates Baldovinetti's Nativity in the Santissima Annunziata and the later paintings of the Nativity by Fra Filippo Lippi in Spoleto and Fra Diamante.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/giovanni/frances/nativit.jpg,nativity

The broadsheet contains of fifteen woodblocks plus a long German prayer. The Nativity in the centre is copied in reverse from a woodcut by Hans von Kulmbach, with whom Traut had worked in DÃ¼rer's atelier. Traut added a few minor details to the figures and the setting. The hand of God directs the viewer to the eleven Passion scenes at the top of the broadsheet. Traut loosely based his designs upon DÃ¼rer's Small Passion. Below are groups of ecclesiastics and secular figures who comprise the Christian estate.Broadsheets, in which the images are accompanied by text, depict extraordinary happenings, omens, historical events, portraits, and traditional folktales. Nativity and Passion of Christ demonstrates clearly the practical function of broadsheets in a semi-literate society. The illustrations are placed around a German prayer which tells of Christ's birth and the redemption of mankind through his Passion. The Nativity with an Adoration of the Shepherds is represented in the centre, above which a hand is shown indicating various scenes from the Passion of Christ, which would be pointed out as the prayer was recited.

_art_v_vos_m_nativity.jpg,"Three little angels kneel with Mary and Joseph in worship of the newborn Child. The ox and the ass stand behind them. Other angels in the distance announce the birth of Christ to a group of shepherds. The ruin behind Joseph symbolises the defeat of paganism by the coming of the Saviour. The artist has made the symbolism even plainer by including a relief in the classical ruin - a recumbent female nude, possibly Venus, and several playful little naked figures. These represent the pagan world and 'impure', earthly love, as opposed to the divine love in which Christ was conceived.Marten de Vos spent some time in Italy, where he familiarised himself with the new art of the Renaissance. This is apparent in details like the lively poses, the realistic approach to the anatomy and the references to classical antiquity. The divided upper zone, one half containing an architectural setting and the other a deep landscape, was also typical of 16th-century Venetian art.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 22 minutes):Thomas Tallis: Mass (Puer natus est) -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/v/vos_m/nativity.jpg,nativity
_art_s_schongau_martin_graphics_3nativit.jpg,"In Schongauer's art may be found a transition between the final - and possibly finest - expression of the Gothic and medieval dream, and the first tentative reaching toward Humanist ideals, soon to come to fruition in the works of Schongauer's admirer, Albrecht DÃ¼rer.Schongauer, like DÃ¼rer and others, received his first training as a goldsmith. A man of many talents, he explored other fields and also became a painter of note. Fortunately, a number of his paintings have survived, and documents indicate that there were many more. His training as a painter is evident in his engravings, where subtle relationships of tone and ""colour"" are suggested by the skillful gradations from black to white.In this engraving, The Nativity, the Gothic storytelling element remains strong. As used in Classical times and throughout the Middle Ages, the tale is told by means of a convention called ""continuous narrative."" Thus, if we look through the pointed arch at the back we see the angel announcing his message to a shepherd. The Nativity takes place, not in a manger, but in the ruins of a vaulted Gothic edifice; this allows the shepherds to move forward to the next stage, and view the scene through an arched aperture.Schongauer anticipates DÃ¼rer's love for such details as the vines overgrowing the ruin, the accurately observed plants growing between the stones in the foreground, and grasses sprouting from crevices. The Virgin, melancholy and ideally beautiful, gazes adoringly at the Child. Joseph holds a lamp to indicate that this scene takes place at night; he has eyes only for Mary. In the upper right-hand corner three angels flutter over the arch, to herald the miracle with their singing.Schongauer's mastery of the art of perspective and of sophisticated composition is evident in this beautiful engraving. There is superb control, too, in his handling of the burin, using crosshatching in the dark areas, and parallel lines, flicks, and broken lines to suggest the textures of soft robes, weathered stones, and human and animal flesh.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Josquin Desprez: In principio erat verbum, motet -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/s/schongau/martin/graphics/3nativit.jpg,nativity

Before arriving at the manger they have been home to put on cleaner clothes; their appearance, faces and expressions are less rough, breathless and astonished. There is more tender adoration in them than wonder, and although they have the posture and gestures of simple folk they are certainly anything but coarse.

_art_d_diaz_stillife.jpg,"Most of the earliest examples of flower paintings that arrived in Spain - especially in court circles - from the Flemish school at the beginning of the 17th century were executed by Jan Brueghel. The first Spanish painter to incorporate flower paintings into still-life scenes was Juan van der Hamen, but the artist who established them in their own right, independently of still-life scenes of foodstuffs, animals and pots and pans, was Juan de Arellano, the most influential practitioner of flower painting in the Iberian Peninsula during the central years of the century. These themes, whether depicted singly, in pairs or in series, were designed to decorate the homes of noble and wealthy families who wished to embellish their residences with decorative, pleasant and colourful paintings, as the main purpose of these pictures was ornamental. DÃ­az, who was active in the rich and noble city of Valladolid, which had been the seat of the court at the beginning of the century, must have had a clientele who commissioned paintings of this kind. Although in his main area of activity, religious painting, he was conservative and showed little evolution when it came to incorporating the novel features of the Baroque language into his style, his flower paintings reveal his knowledge of Flemish art and of the new genres in vogue during the period. The present still-life depicts a a wicker basket containing a bunch of flowers - roses, tulips, irises, hyacinths, daffodils, among others - on a table.

_art_m_master_flemalle_2_annuncia.jpg,"Based on its style the Annunciation is attributed to the Master of FlÃ©malle and dated between c. 1415 and 1425. The painter's provisional name refers to the ""Abbey of FlÃ©malle"" where certain of his works are assumed to have been painted. However, in this village near LiÃ¨ge there was never any abbey. Today the master is commonly identified with the Tournai artist Robert Campin.The scene takes place inside a bourgeois dwelling, a novelty in the painting of the time, as until then the scene had always been depicted in or in front of a church. In line with tradition, Gabriel enters the room from the left. The Virgin is seated in front of a low bench on the tiled floor, a sign of her humility. The edge of her mantle is decorated with an inscription, another innovation of the Master of FlÃ©malle. Its text appears to be inspired by the popular medieval Marian hymn Salve Regina. The Virgin's gestures illustrate her acceptance. Her right hand rests on her breast, her eyes modestly cast downwards. On Mary's lap is an open book, a second one lies on the table. This motif is possibly taken from devotional tracts of around 1400, which state that the Virgin was meditating on the Holy Scriptures when Gabriel entered. The books also indicate her as the possessor of divine wisdom. In this connection, the bench is decorated with little lions, as was once the throne of Solomon, the Old Testament king who used to be seen as the epitome of wisdom. The stained glass figures possibly represent prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah.Other apparently everyday objects also have an additional, deeper significance. The hand broom next to the chimney symbolises the purification from the stain of sin, and the white lilies in the maiolica vase Mary's virginity. The open window probably alludes to her honorary title as 'fenestra coeli', the window of heaven. The candles and their holders refer to Christ and the Virgin. The fact that the candles are snuffed out indicates that conception has already taken place. One intriguing detail is the woodcut above the chimney, depicting St Christopher carrying the Child across the river. This motif is a good illustration of the chronological jumps frequently found in the paintings of Flemish Primitives, as according to the main scene, depicting the Annunciation, the Saviour has not even been born!",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/master/flemalle/2/annuncia.jpg,annunciation

He declaims to the Virgin, 'the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee' (Luke 1, v. 35). She, demure, with a dove fluttering above her head in a burst of golden light, inclines towards him and responds, 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word' (Luke 1, v. 38). Beyond them the picture space extends into the Virgin's chamber, and further, hidden space is hinted at by the bed curtain there which serves also to set off Gabriel's nimbus.Outside the loggia is a delicately painted garden, enclosed by a palisade, symbolic of Mary's virginity. Carved in a roundel above the centre column is a half-length effigy of Isaiah, who had prophesied the birth of a child to a virgin. The pink entablature of the loggia points to the second reference to the Old Testament, in the top left corner, where Adam and Eve are expelled from Paradise.Undoubtedly Angelico's first truly great painting, this Annunciation formed a prototype for a noble line of derivatives.",https://www.wga.hu/art/a/angelico/04/1annunc1.jpg,annunciation

Donatello's ingenuity and skill are specially apparent in the figure of the Virgin herself: frightened by the unexpected appearance of the angel she makes a modest reverence with a charming, timid movement, turning with exquisite grace towards him as he makes his salutation. The Virgin's movement and expression reveal both her humility and the gratitude appropriate to an unexpected gift, particularly a gift as great as this. Moreover, Donatello created a masterly flow of folds and curves in the draperies of the Madonna and angel, suggesting the form of the nude figures and showing how he was striving to recover the beauty of the ancients, which had been lost for so many years.

It presents several problems, both in terms of stylistic analysis and dating.Some scholars, stressing the fact that it is so different stylistically from all the other works of Simone's Avignon period (nervous lines and expressions), think that it may have been painted earlier and then transported to France; others believe that it may be a late work, commissioned by Napoleone Orsini, who died in the Curia in Avignon in 1342.

Here we can see clearly how Lorenzo Veneziano, in his mature work moved increasingly towards the musical expressiveness of colour shot through with Gothic accents. The iconographical scheme of this Annunciation is radically different from that of the Lion polyptych. The figures of the Virgin and the herald angel inhabit the space of the picture in a much more substantial sense, are in much solider bodily contact with the grass and flowers. Indeed this is the first example in Venice of a naturalistic motif which was dear to the hearts of the refined artists working in the International Gothic style.

Both of them are signed and dated (1452) and were probably painted as part of a triptych or polyptych. They reveal Christus as a precise designer of space and moulder of volumes.

The scene of The Annunciation is the left panel on the back of the triptych.The Modena Triptych strikingly illustrates El Greco's transition from post-Byzantine icon painter to European artist of the Latin variety. The portable altarpiece, whose unknown patron perhaps stemmed from a Creto-Venetian family, in its open state shows a total of six scenes: on the front, the central panel bears a rare depiction of the Coronation of the Christian Knight, and on the wings we find the Adoration of the Shepherds on the left and the Baptism of Christ on the right. On the reverse, a View of Mount Sinai with its famous convent of St Catherine is flanked by an Annunciation  and an Admonition of Adam and Eve by God the Father.

_art_b_boccacci_boccacci_1_cremona2.jpg,"The decoration of the Cremona Cathedral was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the faÃ§ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the faÃ§ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht DÃ¼rer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy DÃ¼rer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.A majestic aura fills the space of the Annunciation to Mary.

The patroness of the college, the lady-in-waiting Doña MarÃ­a de CÃ³rdoba y AragÃ³n, had died back in 1593, implying that the commission likely came from her executor. The retable, like many other works in possession of the Church, was disassembled into its component parts during the French occupation of Spain. All we know from the surviving written sources is that El Greco supplied a total of seven paintings. This Annunciation in the Prado is one of these paintings, and it is an especially good example of the daring palette that characterizes the entire series.At the bottom of the canvas, the terrestrial world is barely indicated by the steps, sewing basket and rose-bush in flame. The flames are rendered so naturalistically that they probably have appeared to mirror the real candle flames burning on the altar during the celebration of the Mass. But above and beyond El Greco has distorted light, colour and form. Indeed,all the form are in a state of flux. the grand rhythm of the wings of Gabriel and the Holy Spirit quicken the drama.

(The somewhat oriental, vaulted church, for example, stands for the Old Testament and the Gothic hall for the New Testament, etc.) On the right-hand side of the panel Mary and Elizabeth meet in front of a bare, rocky, mountainous landscape. The background fills up the surface of the picture and adapts to the irregular lines of the frame, but, at the same time, it extends into depth too.The painter has imposed a unity on the surroundings of the two scenes in a variety of ways. One of these is the decision to depict the angel in an open-air setting. He contrasts the brownish, grassy ground outside the group of buildings with the gorgeous flower garden (hortus conclusus) on the left-hand side of the picture, but in this way natural surroundings are integrated with the stone buildings. The two parts of the composition are also ingeniously connected, the smooth plateau of the mountain fitting into the ledges of the round edifice. The Virgin is the static figure on each side, while the Archangel Gabriel and Elizabeth, corresponding in their colours, approach her from opposite directions. The course of their movements is emphasized by the structure of the building with the obliquely placed hall, and by the semicircular line of the precipice in the foreground of the landscape.But further devices, too, contribute to the unity of the composition: the clever use of the complicated form of the frame. Just as the golden ray, which originates from the mouth of God the Father and runs to the Virgin of the Annunciation, the slanting line of the frame leads to the Virgin of the Visitation. (If, in our imagination, we lengthen the divine beam of light upwards, it runs to the peak of the frame.) The upper right and bottom left corners are united by another diagonal line: the imaginary one that connects Gabriel, the Virgin and the angel, and there are additional echoes in the colours of the apparel of all the figures.",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/broederl/01left.jpg,annunciation

The room is lit by little rose windows and other windows of elaborate Gothic design. A frieze of miniature trefoil arches runs along the upper cornice of the room, defining the front edge of its coffered ceiling. An open arched doorway, through which the angel enters, admits to a garden, in which trees laden with fruit can be glimpsed to the far left.

It has been pointed out that the angel comes into the painting from real space, canceling the separation between the picture and the viewer in a way typical of the baroque aesthetic. The angel's face is practically invisible. The Virgin does not look at him, she is completely self-absorbed, her pose is devoid of joyous acceptance.

The artist's fondness for the theme almost certainly derives from the interest aroused in it by the Dominican priest Antonino Pierozzi, Archbishop of Florence in 1446 (died in 1459), and famous for the sermons he gave in the cathedral and which are collected in the 'Summa theologica.' Outstanding among these were the long dissertations, with which Lippi was undoubtedly familiar, on the subject of the Annunciation.It is very likely that this picture was painted in just those years, between 1445 and 1450.The metaphor of light as a metaphysical vehicle, the allegorical significance of the heavenly communication that touches the Virgin on the shoulder, 'super brachium,' and is impressed like a seal, 'ut signaculum,' strongly stimulated the imagination of the painter, who was faced, like so many artists before and after him, with the insoluble problem of how to depict the conception of the Mother of God: ""The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee"" (Luke, 1, 35).In this picture, in which the architectural framework may be the work of an assistant, the artist has painted the hands of God at the top, emerging from the clouds and releasing the dove of the Holy Ghost.

Lippi here participates in a strong perspectival exercise, especially in the buildings that recede into the background. But perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the painting, aside from the placement of both Gabriel and Mary on the right half the picture space, is the trompe l'oeil, transparent vase at the bottom, ready to receive the lilies held by the angel. Here Lippi seems to rival the Flemish masters who were experts at rendering nature objectively.The unusual pose that Lippi selected for his Mary Annunciate, with a strong twist of the body, has a parallel in Donatello's high relief Annunciation which the sculptor carved for the Cavalcanti Chapel in Santa Croce. In fact, the relationship of the standing Mary and the kneeling angel is the same in the two representations, although Lippi's style for representing faces is unmistakable and not related to Donatello's classicism of this period.",https://www.wga.hu/art/l/lippi/filippo/1440/06annunc.jpg,annunciation

_art_w_weyden_rogier_03annunc_2tripti1.jpg,"The Louvre Annunciation is the central panel of a triptych the wings of which are most probably not the work of Rogier. Its style is quite different from that of the Descent from the Cross and shows closer affinities to that of Jan Van Eyck. It even reproduces certain details familiar to us from the Arnolfini Marriage, including the red of the bed clothes and hangings and the carved copper chandelier. Instead of the famous convex mirror, the painting features a copper medallion glinting in the background. This is also a picture replete with symbols in typical Campin style: lily, ewer and basin for purifying water, representing the purity of the Virgin Mary; a phial traversed by a ray of light evoking the miraculous birth; an orange or ""Chinese apple"", fruit of the forbidden tree, reminding us of the necessity of Redemption; extinguished candles, awaiting the coming of the Light, i.e. the Word made flesh.The painting seems to have been designed to suit the Flemish taste for intimate domestic scenes, according to which painters were expected to portray religious themes in familiar bourgeois interiors. Yet, this does not derive from any concern for the minutiae of realist detail, but from properly theological reasons.The new religious tendency in Flanders at that time was the ""devotio moderna"". This doctrine urged the believer to meditate on Christ's humanity, by representing it to himself in the context of his present life. In Rogier's painting, the contemporary setting, underlined by the absence of haloes, is meant to draw the viewer in so that he effectively participates in the scene before him. This is why the angel Gabriel appears before Mary dressed in an immaculate alb and magnificent brocade cope, as if he had come to celebrate mass, rather than deliver a message.",https://www.wga.hu/art/w/weyden/rogier/03annunc/2tripti1.jpg,annunciation

The lively movement of the figures contrasts with these spatial dynamics, which lead towards the background. There is a diagonal line running from the edge of Gabriel's robes to his raised hand, and it continues in the arm which Mary is holding across her chest. The angel's robes, which are billowing in great folds, show that he has just made a sweeping landing. Gabriel is kneeling reverently in front of Mary and his mouth, which is slightly open, suggests that he is in the process of speaking the words of St. Luke's Gospel, which are written underneath him in Latin on the painting's original frame: ""The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.""",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/botticel/22/70cestel.jpg,annunciation

In style it falls between the sparseness of The Annunciation in cell 3 and the richness of the Cortona altarpiece. Unlike in the Cortona version, the garden is here viewed through a colonnade of columns which recede to a vanishing point near the centre of the painting.Under the arches between the Corinthian columns are the slender figures of the Madonna and of the angel in devout converse, regulated with the rhythm of gentle curves; in the background, on the left, the celestial fields with Tuscan cypresses; Gabriel's wings stretch out like a rainbow. It is the theme of the tabernacles which multiply themselves at the crossing of the ways; the greeting taken from the mediaeval hymnology and the invitation addressed to the passer-by and writings under the painting show Angelico's most cultivated devotion: Salve, Mater pietatis / et totius Trinitatis / nobile triclinium / Maria!The lighting of the scene is curiously illogical, the interior of the arcaded loggia is evenly illuminated, despite the fairly strong light coming from the left.",https://www.wga.hu/art/a/angelico/09/corridor/annunci.jpg,annunciation

Indeed it is to him that the canvas owes its overall sense of vibrant reality, its light and its feeling.Nevertheless, Gentileschi reworked the basic style of Caravaggio's expressive art in an unusually rich fashion. He freely applied colour in a manner akin to the great Flemish painters of the day, such as Rubens or Van Dyck, who were either working in Genoa or whose canvases could be viewed there.

From the first of these derive the pose and upward gaze of the angel, the solid haloes with channeling, and the steep perspective of the buildings terminating in a salmon-coloured wall with an open door. From the second, Fra Carnevale has taken the modest stance and gesture of the Virgin.What is completely original to this depiction is the idea of staging the Annunciation in a street bordered by elegant colonnades rather than in the Virgin's bedroom, a cloister, an enclosed garden, or a church-like interior, as was traditional. The buildings, with their salmon and pink trim, are distinctly Florentine in style, although completely unlike those in Lippi's work. The ornamented arches of two of the buildings recall those in the background of Ghiberti's relief of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba on the Gates of Paradise of the Baptistery in Florence.

Lippi here participates in a strong perspectival exercise, especially in the buildings that recede into the background. But perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the painting, aside from the placement of both Gabriel and Mary on the right half the picture space, is the trompe l'oeil, transparent vase at the bottom, ready to receive the lilies held by the angel. Here Lippi seems to rival the Flemish masters who were experts at rendering nature objectively.The unusual pose that Lippi selected for his Mary Annunciate, with a strong twist of the body, has a parallel in Donatello's high relief Annunciation which the sculptor carved for the Cavalcanti Chapel in Santa Croce.

Successive art historians have moved the painting to the early 1440's, comparing it to the Annunciation in Munich and recognizing in it the beginnings of Lippi's attachment to the style of Fra Angelico. The participation of Andrea del Castagno has also been suggested, with a date of around 1440.

She has set aside her basket of handiwork and seems to have been disturbed by an angel in the midst of her prayers. Were it not for the presence of his wings, even the angel would seem to be a very worldly creature. He is not floating in some uncertain sphere, nor is he a vision, but is kneeling on the floor tiles. Strong-limbed and barefoot, almost like a peasant, his pretty face is framed by dark locks. With one hand, he points towards the dove of the Holy Spirit, which floats above their heads in a truly unearthly and intangible celestial vision. With the other hand, he makes a gesture of persuasion: he seems to be explaining the purpose of his mission quite vigorously to Mary.Although the event seems plausible in a distinctly earthly manner - even the putti in the clouds do not alter this impression - the miracle is clear.

With its unusual perspective that places the viewer in mid-air, looking down into the house of Mary, this Annunciation is one of the most intimate works of the cycle in the room. Tintoretto multiples the perspective details, such as the straw-bottomed chair below the angel, which emphasizes the poverty of the Virgin.Of the eight phases into which the Venetian Theatine monk Giovanni Marinoni (1490-1562) divided the story of the Annunciation, Tintoretto's painting shows the second, following the angel's greeting: ""And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be"" (Luke 1:29). In late medieval painting north of the Alps, Mary's conception is often shown as a depiction of the infant Christ flying toward the Virgin on a divine ray of light, like a naked putto. As if to follow the path of the heavenly child's flight exactly, Tintoretto multiplies this motif into a whole phallic swarm of putti.The announcement of the imminent divine maternity is given by the Angel to Mary in surroundings where everything is realistically described down to be the smallest detail: the dilapidated brick base and column; the two-coloured floor of large marble tiles; the straw-bottomed chair which clearly shows the passing of time; the work basket and its contents at the Virgin's feet; in the background the large bed covered by a canopy. No less realistic, even if in a theatrically scenographic sense, is the outside setting where Joseph is busy with his work surrounded by carpenter's tools hung outside the hut. Such objective description of the surroundings is contrasted with the visionary intensity of the miraculous apparition of the heavenly messenger and the joyful evangelical song, which break in from the left.

_art_e_eyckbart_annuncia.jpg,"Our knowledge of the life and work of this artist is based on a series of assumptions. It is thought that he trained in the workshop of Jan van Eyck, and from the 1440s onwards executed miniatures and panel paintings for RenÃ© of Anjou and others of his circle. It is uncertain whether he accompanied RenÃ© to Italy in 1440, during the latter's brief rule over Naples, or whether he was employed by the Dukes of Burgundy during that period. Following RenÃ©'s return in the mid-1440s, BarthÃ©lemy added about five miniatures to one of his older codices (London, British Library), and also illuminated a book of hours for him, in collaboration with Enguerrand Quarton (New York, The Morgan Library and Museum).Between 1443 and 1445 he is believed to have executed a winged altarpiece for Aix-en-Provence. After another extensive series of miniatures, he produced his masterpieces, namely seven miniatures in a French edition of Boccaccio's ThÃ©sÃ©ide (Vienna, Ãsterreichische Nationalbibliothek) and the 16 illustrations to the Livre du Cuer d'Amour espris - these latter representing one of the supreme artistic achievements of their day.The Annunciation, which since the Revolution has been kept in the church of St Mary Magdalene in the Provencal capital, was the main panel of an altarpiece which the clothmaker Pierre Corpici commissioned for the altar which he had endowed in the city's Saint-Sauveur cathedral. While the first impression is of a plain and monumental setting, the painter in fact pays loving attention to the details of the stained glass, the leaves flickering like flames on the capitals, and the heads and bats in the tracery.Although BarthÃ©lemy d'Eyck can be assumed to be related to Jan and Hubert van Eyck, the present work falls fully in line with artistic practice in the Mediterranean sphere - from its thicker, less translucent application of paint to the gold brocade of the Virgin's cloak. At the same time, its astonishing realism at times goes far beyond even Netherlandish painting. There is a pronounced three-dimensionality to the composition as a whole; forms are weighty and substantial, while skin surfaces are sharply differentiated. Mary's hair is not perfectly coiffured, but instead full, almost flaxen. The wonderfully observed, plump cushions and the bunch of flowers also have a quite different spatial presence to their northern counterparts. This impression is reinforced on the one hand by the relatively plain metal jug and the quietly unforced arrangement of the flowering Marian symbols plucked, so it seems, at random from the garden, and on the other by the surrounding empty space and the sharp, spotlight type of lighting.The architecture also appears solid and three-dimensional, and is wonderfully observed against the light - as in the tracery on the left above the angel's wing, and the roundel through which the Christ Child floats down, already shouldering his Cross. The figures listening to Mass and strolling around at the back of the church lend the composition an astonishing depth, even though the artist - doubtless deliberately - has not attempted to depict the room and the figures to scale.",https://www.wga.hu/art/e/eyckbart/annuncia.jpg,annunciation
_art_m_mazzoni_sebastia_annuncia.jpg,"The Florentine artist Sebastiano Mazzoni, who was a poet and architect as well as a painter, rivals Francesco Maffei as the most lively and imaginative painter of the Baroque period in Venice. Under the influence of Fetti, Liss and above all Strozzi, Mazzoni aimed for a style of airily elegant images moving in a space with which he could experiment ex novo in freely imaginative terms. His early training in Tuscany did however remain influential with the result that in Mazzoni the decorative exuberance of Maffei seems to be passed through an intellectual filter even in the bolder examples of figure painting.In the Annunciation, the angel bends over the Virgin who is depicted humbly accepting the divine message. Against the architectural background, the two figures spread over the limited space, while their colours are of the most refined. This lyrical evocation of reality through highly coloured facets dissolved into the atmosphere in dancing rhythms was to be completely understood only in the eighteenth century.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/mazzoni/sebastia/annuncia.jpg,annunciation

The two figures fill almost the whole space, hardly any help comes from the folds of the garments, here the bodies themselves have come into their own.

Tucher and the city officially broke with the Catholic Church and embraced Lutheranism in 1525. Lutheranism had no need for most religious art; the Angelic Salutation, as a devotional object with no liturgical function, was in peril.

It is not surprising that the choice of sculptors fell on two artists working in Rome, Bernardino Cametti and, subsequently,  Agostino Cornacchini (1686-1754).As a supremely gifted designer, Juvarra had definite ideas about the nature of the reliefs, and Cametti's Annunciation must have fulfilled them.

He was able to find the traditional Renaissance form of a painted window with a view of a landscape in many Florentine palaces. They can still be seen today in Florence, examples being the palaces of the Medici, Ruccelai and Strozzi families. The angel is derived from the Annunciation painted by the young Leonardo da Vinci between 1472 and 1475, now on view in the Galleria degli Uffizi.In contrast to Leonardo's horizontal format, in Ghirlandaio's fresco in the predetermined vertical format his Virgin may be depicted facing the observer in an equally frontal view, but she is standing upright.

_art_m_masolino_panels_annuncia.jpg,"Fifteenth-century viewers of this Annunciation would have recognized not only its general subject, but also the particular moment Masolino chose to paint. Street preachers gave vivid accounts of Gabriel's message to Mary about Christ's birth, and audiences would also have  seen the Annunciation reenacted on its feast day. In Florence, Brunelleschi designed an apparatus to lower an actor portraying Gabriel from the cathedral dome, as  young children dressed as angels hung suspended in rigging. Events in the drama took place in sequence. Mary was first startled at the angel's sudden appearance; she reflected on his message and queried Gabriel about her fitness; finally, kneeling, she submitted to God's will. Here Mary's downcast eyes and musing gesture -- hand resting tentatively on her breast -- suggest the second, and most often depicted, of these stages: reflection. As did actors in the religious plays, artists used gesture and posture to communicate states of mind.Masolino is best known for his collaboration with Masaccio on the frescoes of the Brancacci chapel in Florence -- and for his failure to pursue Masaccio's innovations. Masolino continued to paint in a style that was delicate and ornamental. His colors are flowerlike, his figures elegant but unreal. They do not seem so much to exist within the painted space as to be placed before it. In the ceiling, colorful tiles, a device used by Masaccio to create perspective lines, are merely decorative and leave space ambiguous.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/masolino/panels/annuncia.jpg,annunciation

_art_b_boccacci_boccacci_1_cremona3.jpg,"The decoration of the Cremona Cathedral was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the faÃ§ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the faÃ§ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht DÃ¼rer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy DÃ¼rer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.The broad atmospheric landscape of the Annunciation to Joachim emulates Giorgione's inventions.

_art_t_tiziano_06_1560s_03salvad.jpg,"Withdrawing into a noble creative isolation in which he explored new forms of expression, Titian painted a series of works on sacred and secular subjects for the court of Spain and other clients. The Annunciation in the Church of San Salvador near the Rialto is Titian's key religious painting of the 1560s. It is one of Titian's boldest and most freely painted late works. Here the warm, rich colour blurs the outlines of the figures and turns the painting into a shimmering iridescent haze.The traditionally acquiescent pose of the Virgin, with arms crossed as she receives the message, has been transferred to the angel since Titian has here chosen to depict the moment just after the actual Annunciation itself. The Virgin, having lifted her veil to receive the Word, remains in suspended animation as she absorbs it, while the angel stands in awestruck reverence at the implications of the news just imparted and at the mystery of the incarnation. There is a materiality about this painting that belies its otherworldliness. Gabriel's wings are the reverse of feathery and have the surface density of beaten brass, yet the viewer is seduced into believing that the wings of angels could exist in no other form.The composition derives from a lost Annunciation that Titian painted in 1537 for the nuns of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Murano.

_art_zzdeco_2tapestr_1_03n_1401.jpg,"Tapestries provided a very suitable medium for the stylistic expression of the International Gothic art. While, in general, tapestry weaving attempted to solve the same problems as those raised by painting, the opposite can be observed in the period about 1400: it was then in fact painters who endeavoured to achieve effects like tapestry by the homogeneous texture of their pictures, which were made up from tiny, dense and decoratively stylized repeated elements. It is a characteristic feature of the International Gothic style to endeavour to make the various motifs appear to be of the same quality, and to give them the fluid lines of textiles. These endeavours felicitously made use of the possibilities offered by tapestry-weaving.In general terms the composition follows that of Broederlam's Annunciation; it is from the open air that the angel approaches the Virgin, who is enthroned in a chapel-like building. The upper outlines of the chapel are set off by the contrast of the brown mountain which looms up behind the building. On the left luxuriant vegetation stretches up towards the sky, where a half length figure of God the Father appears surrounded by a golden mandorla. Narrow bands of white cloud form a rhythmically repeated pattern on the sky around him. The building looks as if it were made of some rigid fabric, for its column is like a thick cluster of cables, decorated with recurrent multicoloured motifs. The bottom edge is a fluctuating line, as if the ground were creeping up the wall. This may be a stylized version of the hillside to be seen beside Broederlam's pavilion. As though to counter-balance the luxuriant vegetation on the left side, the floor of the chapel is covered with a mosaic of amazing variety. There are no duplicates among the geometrical forms, which alternate with stylized foliate motifs. The natural surroundings are also luxuriantly decorative: plants of different kinds will spring from the same stock. However, it is not only with the abundance of forms of trees, leaves and flowers that the forest astonishes us, but with its sense of magic and mystery. The trunks of the trees with their vibrant lines, the flowers, which resemble stars, and the clusters of leaves are illuminated by shimmering lights. The same vegetation that is resplendent in bright colours in front of the building and on the left side of the tapestry, darkens behind the angel on the right creating, as if by magic, a mysterious, nocturnal darkness around the heavenly messenger, a darkness out of which only a few stylized foliate forms shine forth. The rigid stems apparontly have no connection with the petals (for example between the wings and the back of the angel). This vegetation has marked affinities with the foliate forms in the so-called Paris Apocalypse, a work also produced in the Low Countries, where the same motifs again produce a most expressive effect.",https://www.wga.hu/art/zzdeco/2tapestr/1/03n_1401.jpg,annunciation

The present set is related to Madrid on account of a specific iconographic detail. In all these scenes the Virgin's head is surrounded by a halo formed by the twelve stars of St John's vision in the Apocalypse, as if it were a representation of the Immaculate Conception, whereas the other figures display the usual halos of unbroken lines.

Mary has been reading at a prie-dieu when God the Father burst in from the loggia, stretching forth his hands as if sending down the dove of the Holy Spirit, although no dove is seen. Gabriel runs in from the door bearing a huge lily and drops suddenly to one knee. Mary turns toward us and opens her hands in wonder. A cat scurries away in terror, casting a shadow on the floor, as does the rushing angel.The Recanati Annunciation is one of Lotto's best-loved works, above all for its refreshingly original and unrhetorical treatment of a very familiar theme. The holy figures are represented in a way that is touchingly direct, almost naive, and the scene is lent a further immediacy by the detailed description of the Virgin's bedchamber and garden beyond and by the quasi-humorous prominence of the frightened cat.The painting was executed for the oratory of Santa Maria sopra Mercanti, where it remained until 1953, when it was transferred to the museum. The artist had already returned to Venice when he executed this agitated, very personal interpretation of the theme. Although the painting is generally dated to the late 1520s, recently it was proposed from stylistic considerations that it dates from soon after Lotto's return to the Marches in 1533.",https://www.wga.hu/art/l/lotto/5/06annun1.jpg,annunciation

For this he made an ornament in the grotesque style, with a base of varied and intertwined work, surmounted by a quartercircle, and with six putti; these garlanded putti have their arms round each other as if they are afraid of the height and are trying to steady themselves. Donatello's ingenuity and skill are specially apparent in the figure of the Virgin herself: frightened by the unexpected appearance of the angel she makes a modest reverence with a charming, timid movement, turning with exquisite grace towards him as he makes his salutation. The Virgin's movement and expression reveal both her humility and the gratitude appropriate to an unexpected gift, particularly a gift as great as this. Moreover, Donatello created a masterly flow of folds and curves in the draperies of the Madonna and angel, suggesting the form of the nude figures and showing how he was striving to recover the beauty of the ancients, which had been lost for so many years. He displayed such skill and facility that, in short, no one could have bettered his design, his jjudgment, his use of the chisel, or his execution of the work.""

_art_l_lippi_filippo_1440_10annun.jpg,"An orphan placed in the friary as a child, Fra Filippo took his vows at Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence in 1421, in time to observe Masaccio and Masolino at work on the famous frescoes there. He was more suited to the life of a painter than to that of a Carmelite, for in 1456, while chaplain to a convent in Prato, he induced a nun to elope with him. She was to bear him a child, Filippino, who grew up to be an excellent painter of outstandingly chaste morals. Filippo was employed as an artist by the Medici, and through their intercession obtained a special dispensation to marry Filippino's mother.The Annunciation is one of a pair of panels originally from a Medici palace in Florence; the other, hanging also in the National Gallery, depicts seven saints of special significance to the family. The shape and subject matter of both panels suggest that they were part of the furnishings of two separate but related rooms, either as bed-heads or as panels situated above a bed or door. While the Seven Saints illustrates a dynastic theme through the male members of the family, the Annunciation would have been more suitable for a woman's room.The Medici device of three feathers within a diamond ring is `sculpted' in relief on the edge of the parapet which separates the Virgin's `garden enclosed' from her bedchamber. Mary's purity is further alluded to in the lilies held by the Archangel Gabriel and those growing in the urn between them. From the centre of the arched top of the panel the hand of God the Father has launched the dove of the Holy Spirit. Its spiraling flight path, outlined in glittering gold, is about to end in the Virgin's womb from which emanates a small scattering of gold rays. In Mary's submissive pose Lippi illustrates the moment in the Gospel of Saint Luke (l: 38) when she says: `Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.'All the qualities for which the Medici prized Fra Filippo's art are demonstrated in this image. The austerity of the centralised perspective (the slope of the floor is exaggerated to account for the angle at which the panel was originally to be viewed) and of the strict geometry inherited from Masaccio is tempered by the artist's sublimely delicate use of line, colour and ornament. The Virgin's transparent veil gently softens the curve of her neck and shoulders, Gabriel's peacock wings echo the curve of the arch. But the greatest beauty of the painting resides in the meeting of angel and Virgin, virtual mirror images of each other. The one inclines his profiled head and bends his arm in gentle deference, the other responds with grave humility.",https://www.wga.hu/art/l/lippi/filippo/1440/10annun.jpg,annunciation

The Virgin has stopped reading and reacts to the Annunciation with an expression of deep respect and by gesturing with her left hand. There is a conspicuous perspectival mistake: her right arm had to be painted too long proportionally, so that, despite her seated position, it would still be able to depict the impressive position other hand over the prie-dieu. Leonardo depicted Mary in a three-quarter profile in front of the corner of a room. All three spatial coordinates - height, width and depth - converge on this point, thus creating a sense of depth in the picture as well as enhancing the importance of Mary. Her head clearly contrasts with the dark wall and her body is emphatically framed by the cornerstones whose parallel lines are converging on her.The work came to the Uffizi in 1867 from the monastery of San Bartolomeo of Monteoliveto, near Florence. It was ascribed to Domenico Ghirlandaio until 1869, when some critics recognised it as a youthful work by Leonardo, executed around 1472-1475, when he was still an apprentice in the workshop of his master, Andrea del Verrocchio. The sacred scene is set in the garden of a Florentine palace, with a landscape on the background which is already peculiarly Leonardesque, for the magic and unreal atmosphere created by mountains, water and sky. Leonardo's personality is pointed out also in the beautiful drapery of the Virgin and the Angel, while the marble table in front of her probably quotes the tomb of Piero and Giovanni dei Medici in the church of San Lorenzo sculpted by Verrocchio in this period.",https://www.wga.hu/art/l/leonardo/01/2annunc.jpg,annunciation

He began his career working for a publisher designing popular satirical engravings and prints after Bosch. When he began to paint around 1560 he found his patrons among the leading intellectuals and rich bankers of Antwerp. Many of his pictures reflect the farces, allegorical plays and processions presented by the literary societies to which such people belonged and which were central to the intellectual and festive life of Netherlandish cities.It is difficult to believe that a theme like the Adoration could be conceived in a satirical spirit, yet the caricatural element may have a serious moral point. As the kings offer or wait to offer their gold, frankincense and myrrh to the Christ Child, the crowd has eyes only for the rich presents. The townsman in glasses on the right seems to look at the Moorish king Balthazar's magnificent censer with open-mouthed greed. (It is indeed a splendid example of contemporary goldsmith's art, a golden ship constructed around a precious nautilus shell surmounted by a crystal orb.)

_art_g_gossart_04religi_1adorat1.jpg,"This Adoration is thought to have been the altarpiece of the Lady Chapel of Sint-Adriaansabdij, Geraardsbergen. It was commissioned by a local nobleman, Daniel van Boechout, Lord of Boelare, who was to be buried in the chapel.The sumptuous huge panel has been elaborated in dazzlingly crisp detail, without compromising the clarity and focus of the whole. In the ruinous edifice of the Old Dispensation, the kings of the earth with their retinues, awestruck shepherds and the nine celestial orders of angels join to adore the newborn Child, seated on his mother's lap as upon a throne. Caspar has offered gold coins in a gold chalice; his name is incised on its lid lying next to his hat and golden sceptre at the hem of the Virgin's gown. Balthazar advancing on the left is identified by the inscription adorning his crown, and the artist has signed his name below. The border of the cloth on which Balthazar, like a priest at the altar, holds his precious offering, is embroidered with the first words of the hymn to the Virgin, Salve Regina: 'Hail Queen, mother of mercy, life, sweetness...' The artist's second signature is incorporated in the neck ornament of Balthazar's black follower. The third king, Melchior, waits on the right. On the hillside behind his retinue the angel is announcing Christ's birth to the shepherds. Joseph, in red and with a cane, stands at some distance gazing up to Heaven. Although generally following Netherlandish precedent, Gossart shows his awareness of modern, and even foreign, art: the dog in the right foreground is copied directly from DÃ¼rer's famous engraving of the miraculous conversion of Saint Eustace, dated to 1500/1.Two unusual features of the imagery are the dove of the Holy Spirit descending from the star, which becomes a symbol of God the Father - so that the three persons of the Trinity are represented in the Adoration - and the Virgin holding the chalice offered by Caspar. Jesus seems to proffer one of the gold coins. Of the three gifts which the Wise Men from the East presented to the Child (Matthew 2:11) the myrrh, later used to embalm Christ's body, traditionally symbolised his sacrifice; the frankincense was specified in the Old Testament as an incense reserved for the tabernacle of the Lord; the gold was tribute paid by kings to the King, after the example of Solomon. Yet perhaps an additional significance is suggested here in the Child's gesture. The royal tribute will be redeemed in blood - the eucharistic wine - through the Saviour's infinite charity.Gossart's painting provokes close reading, although its general message within the Christian story is clear. It is perhaps the last great exemplar of that painstaking art of the Netherlands which spared no labour to place at the feet of the Virgin and her Son a minute description of the costliest products of human craft - the wares of goldsmiths, weavers, furriers, embroiderers, tailors, hatters and bootmakers - arrayed on panel through ingenious mastery of the painter's brush. As a testimonial to his own craft or to show his devotion, the artist may have included his own likeness, peeping out of a narrow doorway behind the ox at the Virgin's shoulder.Gossart's main source of inspiration seems to have been the Monforte Altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes. In addition, the artist also borrowed from prints by DÃ¼rer and Schongauer (e.g. the dogs from Schongauer's Adoration of the Kings, and DÃ¼rer's St Eustace).Recent technical examination of Gossart's paintings led to the suggestion that Gerard David collaborated with Gossart on some paintings including the present Adoration. It is assumed that, in addition to some other details, the head of the Virgin was painted by Gerard David, whose influence on Gossart is shown by a comparison with David's Adoration of the Kings in London.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/gossart/04religi/1adorat1.jpg,adoration

A fervent supporter of Savonarola, he and his brothers took part in the armed defence of the monk in San Marco in 1498. He was a friend of Andrea del Sarto.There are very few documents relating to the career of Luca di Andrea. In 1494 he is cited in the documents of the San Frediano frieze, and in 1500 in those of the Chapel of San Bartolo in Sant'Agostino in San Gimignano. In 1518, he and Raphael were commissioned by Pope Leo X for producing the floors of the papal loggias. Two altarpieces, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Deposition in the church of the Franciscan monastery of San Lorenzo in Bibbiena, generally attributed to the workshop of Andrea della Robbia, were probably executed by him between 1513 and 1520.The classical and up-to-date language of the two altarpieces can be seen as the fruit of a successful marriage of ideas and intention between the artist and his clients, Pope Leo X and Cardinal Bibbiena, whose coats of arms are set at the ends of the two predellas.

_art_b_bassano_jacopo_1_05adorat.jpg,"The Adoration of the Shepherds is an imposing composition dating from around 1544-45 and the time of the artists early maturity. It was during this decade that Bassano painted a number of successful works on a large scale, which helped to establish him as a major artist of the Venetian school.The main compositional features of this painting are the treatment of the architecture, the Virgin's expression of concern for the Child, and the figure of the shepherd who acknowledges the Holy Family by removing his headgear. These features appear to be derived from a painting of the same subject by Titian, the original of which was painted for the Duke of Urbino in 1532-34 and may be the ruined panel in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence. Bassano clearly knew of Titian's painting, but almost certainly through the woodcut by the Master I.B. (Giovanni Boitto), which he seems to have made use of in the 1530s. The composition follows the same direction as the print, which reverses Titian's painting. It is notable that Bassano often redeployed figures in his paintings so that the figure of Joseph in the present work is found in reverse in the Rest on the Flight into Egypt and the kneeling shepherd in the foreground is used in reverse in the Adoration of the Magi. Apparently, from quite an early date, the artist kept a stock of drawings in his studio for this purpose.Apart from Titian, other influences have been cited in the context of Bassano's composition. The architectural features and the shepherd playing the bagpipes recall the woodcut of the Nativity in DÃ¼rer's Little Passion of 1511. On a general basis the naturalistic aspects of the composition are often compared with Netherlandish painting, particularly the work of artists such as Pieter Aertsen. Such observations perhaps over-emphasise the eclectic elements in Bassano's art when it is preferable to stress the scale of the work, the firm drawing, the warm colouring and the view of the artist's home town of Bassano del Grappa, seen in the background against the mountains. Iconographically, the broken elements of the classical architecture denote the passing of the Old Law in favour of the New Law symbolised by the Christ Child.

_art_t_tintoret_3b_2upper_2_22adora.jpg,"The Adoration of the Shepherds is the first canvas on the outside wall of the Sala Superiore (Upper Hall). In an open scenic illusionism, the shepherds below present their gifts with impassioned and joyous gestures. They are counterpointed by the light and shadow created by the brightness from outside; above, main and secondary figures taking part in the divine event take on attitudes of conscious, almost solemn participation and are dazzled by the light which streams through the cracks between the wooden beams of the humble barn. The two different spiritual moments are underlined also by the different colour quality: without breaking the continuity the lower part is continually struck by reverberations and reflections and at the same time carefully and realistically evokes the animals in the stall, the brightly coloured peacock, the humble tools; the upper part is calmer and more relaxed although the wide chromatic background painting is strengthened by sudden, flashing rays of light.As so often in the works of Tintoretto, it is difficult to decide whether the horizontal seam on the gigantic canvas inspired him to create this unusual composition on two levels, or whether, conversely, he aimed to conceal the seam with the aid of the composition. Despite their poor surroundings, the Holy Family are remote from earthly regions.

A good example of this is the Adoration of the Magi, in which one can clearly see how Altichiero has combined the Giottesque character of the figures with the penchant for narrative detail that is more in tune with the taste of his own time. He does this by directing the attention of the viewer to the retinue of people from the Orient, to the humble appearance of the stable, and to the clothing, with its often contemporary, ultrafashionable cut and high-quality materials.

_art_g_goes_1_adorati.jpg,"Hugo van der Goes painted this work in the closing years of his life, presumably a decade after the Monforte Altarpiece, after he had retired in 1478 into a monastery near Brussels as a lay-brother. The peculiar flatness of the faces and the contrived nature of the whole composition are symptomatic of his later period, in which transitory motifs also become prominent. Although this panel may lack the cohesion of the Monforte Altarpiece, one can still detect in it - particularly in the undignified intrusion of the shepherds - a bold and final attempt by a great artist, who was close to death, to break with accepted tradition in painting and strike out along a new path.The Virgin and Joseph are kneeling - almost symmetrically placed - on either side of the crib which, viewed end-on, adds depth to the scene. Angels are crowding round behind the crib in order to be near the Child. Through an opening in the wall in the right background one has a glimpse of the shepherds in the fields, receiving the glad news. On the left side of the picture, two of them rush in, baring their heads as they enter. The entire scene is revealed to the observer by two prophets in the foreground, who draw the curtains back and create the illusion of 'unveiling' it.The unusually wide yet shallow format of the picture has given rise to the suggestion that it may have been originally designed as a predella. But such an assumption would presuppose an altar of enormous dimensions, the existence of which could not have remained completely unknown. Besides, there is no evidence of predellas in Netherlandish painting, so for the time being the artist's purpose must remain a matter of conjecture.In his Adoration of the Shepherds the painter created something that is far removed from his earlier work, the Monforte Altarpiece. There the composure and dignity of the kings and the natural simplicity of their bearing contrast sharply with the commotion and crowding of the later work, which gives the impression of being somewhat contrived.

_art_l_lippi_filippo_1450_3adorati.jpg,"From the mid-1450s through the mid-1460s, Filippo Lippi evolved a new presentation of the Virgin and Child that became popular in the second half of the Quattrocento in Florence. The composition and iconography were grounded in two traditions: St Bridget of Sweden's account of her vision of the Virgin adoring the Christ Child lying upon the ground, and early Renaissance Tuscan depictions of the Nativity. Fra Filippo transformed the subject into a distinct devotional image set within an elaborated forested landscape with a rich imagery of sylvan flora, geological features, and atmosphere, which functioned as visual metaphors for the Incarnation, penitence, and eremitical religious devotion.Fra Filippo's first version of this type was this Adoration (ostensibly a Nativity), made for the Benedictine Annalena nunnery in Florence around 1455. In this composition St Joseph is present beside the Virgin and Child, the ass and ox lie placidly in the manger, and shepherds look on, while angels bearing the inscription ""Gloria in excelsis Deo"" hover above.Lippi's subsequent elaborations of this type, however, omit these narrative markers: the triptych for Alfonso of Naples, whose lost central panel is known only through a rapid sketch by Fra Filippo and the surviving wings representing Sts Anthony Abbot and Michael, the altarpiece for the chapel in the Palazzo Medici, and a painting said to have come from a cell in the Camaldoli hermitage, dedicated to the Baptist and patronized by Piero di Cosimo de' Medici and his wife Lucrezia Tornabuoni, built in 1463.These images are set in a dark, wooden landscape where the Madonna kneels, her hands clasped together in devotion, before the Christ Child lying virtually nude upon the verdant forest ground. God the Father (or simply his hands) in the Camaldoli picture) appears above and the Holy Spirit descends toward the Child, proceeded by tongues of fire. The Child is surrounded by an aura of dancing gilded flames and the Virgin and Child truly glow with divine light.In this version the Holy Family is represented together with St Hilary, St Jerome and St Magdalene.",https://www.wga.hu/art/l/lippi/filippo/1450/3adorati.jpg,adoration

_art_g_greco_el_04_0404grec.jpg,"The earliest reference to the painting appears in Francisco de los Santos, DescripciÃ³n . . . del Escorial, published in 1657, when it was in the sacristy of the Pantheon: ' . . . commonly called the ""Glory of El Greco"" on account of the Glory above, but there is also represented, below, Purgatory and Hell, and on the other side, the Church Militant, with an immense number of the Faithful in adoration, raising their hands and eyes to Heaven, and among them Philip II; in the middle of the Glory is the Name of Jesus adored by Angels . . . signifying the words of Saint Paul In Nomine Jesu omne genu, flectatur Caelestium, Terrestrium, &amp; Infernorum' (Saint Paul, Epistle to the Philippians, II, 10).The subject, then, is the Adoration of the Name of Jesus, a Jesuit counterpart of the Adoration of the Lamb, and incorporates the 'Church Militant', represented by the Holy League.  The Name of Jesus is represented by the trigram IHS with a cross above that appears in a burst of glory at the top of the composition. The painting has also been called An Allegory of the Holy League because of the presence of the main participants of the Holy League. The popular title, the 'Dream of Philip II', is more recent.The painting must certainly have been made for Philip II, but no documents refer to it and it is strangely not mentioned by SigÃ¼enza in his description of the Escorial, published in 1608. The occasion of the commission may well have been the death of Juan of Austria in 1577, and the translation of his body to the Pantheon in 1578. The painting was in the Pantheon when los Santos described it. Juan of Austria was the general in charge of the forces of the Holy League at the victory of Lepanto in 1571.The three members of the Holy League, Spain, Venice and the Papal States are represented by the three kneeling figures of Philip II, Doge Mocenigo and Pope Pius V, and the one prominent figure of the foreground group, kneeling in heroic pose, and holding a sword, can represent no other than the general in charge at Lepanto. It is an ideal representation, while the King, Pope and Doge are actual portraits. Sir Anthony Blunt first suggested that this Adoration of the Name of Jesus was an allegory of the Holy League (the 'Church Militant'), and was possibly commissioned for the tomb of the Spanish General in the Pantheon. That is, it was more in the nature of a private commission for the King, and not part of the scheme of decoration of the Escorial. This could explain the absence of documents.The spirit of universal adoration is brilliantly conveyed. For the general arrangement of the painting, El Greco seems, appropriately, to have referred to his Allegory of a Christian Knight, of the Modena Triptych. The figures of the King, Pope, Doge and Juan of Austria take the place of the three Theological Virtues. The Jaws of Hell and the representation of Purgatory are very similar. The figure of Don Juan of Austria is inspired by Michelangelo. So special a commission could hardly have been the subject of a test-piece for the Escorial as has generally been suggested. The Martyrdom of Saint Maurice and His Legions was a specific commission (and the only commission) for the Escorial.There is a reduced autograph version of the painting in the National Gallery, London.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/greco_el/04/0404grec.jpg,adoration

_art_l_luca_adoratio.jpg,"This Adoration of the Magi employs a conventional composition, however, it is also a good example of the evolution taking place in painting in the second half of the 14th century, especially in Italy, towards a closer imitation of nature, in a desire to represent reality. Thus, while the landscape is indicated in no more than conventional shorthand and is compositionally subordinate to the main scene, located in the immediate foreground, the artist has succeeded in creating a sense of real space between the figures, who are also depicted in more or less naturalistic proportion. This sense of three-dimensional space is achieved in the foreground through the arrangement of the Virgin's robe, the two angels on the right (who are modelled with great skill and harmony both in their colouring and volumes), and the empty spaces. We see a real ground and can appreciate how Joseph, situated in a second plane further back, contributes to the impression of depth.The painting illustrates how, in their striving towards the imitation of nature along the path to the Renaissance, artists first conquered the representation of the human body. Since the primary aim of painting was still to relate stories, mainly religious ones, landscape and other elements of secondary importance served simply as the backdrop to the principal events.",https://www.wga.hu/art/l/luca/adoratio.jpg,adoration
_art_b_botticel_21_20adorat.jpg,"Somewhere around 1475, Botticelli painted the famous Adoration of the Magi for Guasparre di Zanobi del Lama, a work in which the artist also depicted himself. This painting established Botticelli's fame in Florence, and may rightfully be considered the high point of his early artistic output.Guasparre del Lama was a parvenu from the humblest background with a dubious past - he had been convicted of the embezzlement of public funds in 1447. He had been working since the 1450s as a broker and money-changer, something which brought him considerable wealth. In order that he might also obtain the high social standing which he lacked, he enrolled in the most prestigious brotherhoods and endowed a chapel in Santa Maria Novella, which he decorated with Botticelli's altar-piece. Del Lama's career did not last long, for he soon slipped back into his dishonest business practices.Del Lama may be seen among the crowd of people on the right-hand side of the picture, an elderly man with white hair and a light blue robe looking at the observer and pointing in the latter's direction with his right hand. The most famous members of the Medici family are portrayed together with del Lama; controversy rages as to their precise identification, although there is no doubt that the eldest king, kneeling before the Virgin and the Christ Child, is a representation of Cosimo the Elder, founder in the 1430s of what would be dynastic rule by the Medici family over Florence for many years to come. Other members: Cosimo's son Piero, called the Gouty, as the kneeling king with red mantle in the centre, Lorenzo the Magnificent as the young man at his right, in profile, with a black and red mantle.A comparison of Botticelli's painting with his earlier representations of the Adoration (both in the National Gallery, London)) reveals the extent to which the artist had further developed and compensated for his earlier weaknesses. The ground rises gently, so that the faces of almost everyone present can be seen, as can the great variety of postures and gestures that these figures embody. However, Botticelli has combined those involved in an ever more compelling fashion to create a dramatic unity, one concentrated wholly upon the main event. Furthermore, he has moved the central king slightly away from the main axis, enabling the observer's gaze to fall unimpeded upon the Virgin, who is now no longer in danger of becoming lost in the throng, as was still the case in the London portrayal.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Ottorino Respighi: Trittico Botticelliano - L'adorazione dei Magi -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/botticel/21/20adorat.jpg,adoration
_art_m_master_vienna_adorati.jpg,"This panel shows the mature Soft Style in admirable purity. The gentle carriage and devotion-inspiring countenance of the Virgin are in keeping with the solemn genuflexion of the kings approaching with presents. The group of, as it were, boneless figures, so flexible as to tolerate moulding into any attitude at will, strives to evoke an ideal world where gracility of the Gothic line is the supreme law, believed to ennoble every visible figure and manifestation. The luxuriant greensward of long blades of grass strewn with white flowers emphasizes the plane-like arrangement of the figures; perspective seems to have been immaterial to the artist.The painter was given his name after a work representing the Adoration of Jesus, which is preserved in Vienna. His picture in Budapest is the size of a folio and is (like his other works) a domestic altar painted with the delicacy of a miniature.The scene takes place in a rocky landscape with flowers and grass, which lack any geometrical order and any architecture. The Magi, having arrived from the left without a retinue, are about to reverentially hand over their gifts to the Virgin and Child seated on the right. Balthasar, the youngest among them, is a nearly symmetrical counterpart of the figure of the Madonna, who is bending slightly forwards. Balthasar's rather feminine figure and the wing-like, fluttering back edge of his garment reminds us of the Archangel Gabriel of the Annunciation. The top left corner is filled by the figure of a youthful shepherd, characterized by colours identical with the Virgin's. He is leaning with his elbow against the background. Like repeated designs with small variations clumps of softly moving grass, weightlessly curving and bending like pond weed, appear in the foreground interspersed with a diversity of flowers, whose petals are spread like points of a star. The Virgin's left hand, with the fingers opening like petals, is a telling example of the way of thinking in terms of ornamental designs, and is characteristic both of the painter and of the period.Soft modelling is very evident in the whole composition. When he had carefully arranged the edges of the draperies on the ground and meticulously conveyed the difference between the parts of the folds in the light and those in shade, the painter paid greater attention to them than to the rather schematic and blank faces. To such an extent is softness a part of his art that he had difficulties in depicting hard, metallic surfaces (see, for example, the modelling of the crowns and the presents). The Master of the Vienna Adoration learned a lot from the Master of Trebon, who was a generation older than him. The Virgin's figure, gently bent slightly forwards, her round head with a lofty forehead, and the softly drawn and carefully arranged deep folds of her mantle are reminiscent of the picture of HlubokÃ¡. The uncertain representation of the pose of kneeling is also similar in the two pictures.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/master/vienna/adorati.jpg,adoration

_art_m_master_zunk_fl_16_paint_2_01adorat.jpg,"In comparison with other artistic centres, Antwerp had relatively little tradition in art in the beginning of the 16th century: but it was fertile ground ready to receive the seeds of new ideas brought by the many artists who flocked to the town on the Scheldt from other towns in the Low Countries. This burgeoning artistic life yielded religious works based on iconographic and compositional formulae derived from foreign examples. Moreover, the Low Countries' own traditional church based art had reached a crisis, and signs could already be seen heralding the advent of a different type of painting all together, with the birth of the Italian Renaissance. The economic and social revolution which transformed the needs and demands of art lovers resulted in a much looser relationship between artist and patron. Artists no longer felt obliged to bow to specific requirements as to the form or content of the painting imposed by the patron or institution commissioning it. Instead, they began to feel that their responsibility was rather to satisfy the tenets of taste held by nameless international artistic circles in which they moved. Thus an art market was created. Artists began to specialise, made life easier for themselves by repeating certain motifs over and over again, and aimed to create a certain effect. The anonymous Adoration of the Magi is an admirable example of the most popular subject of these artists, who are known as the Antwerp Mannerists.

_art_l_leonardo_02_1adorati.jpg,"Since the Early Christian era, the 6 January has been celebrated as the feast of Epiphany, the appearance of God amongst men in the form of Jesus Christ. Mankind is represented by the Three Kings, who are paying homage to the Messiah. The fall of the pagan world began at the same time as his appearance. Leonardo appears to have depicted this moment, so dramatic in human history, in his panel. It remained unfinished because Leonardo left Florence and moved to Milan, though we do not know why he did so. Chemical reactions and soiling mean it is now difficult to read this fascinating panel in detail.With this painting Leonardo declares his independence from Verrocchio, emerging with a fresh, personal style. Although unfinished, this painting is far more innovative than his previous works. The composition is constructed around a central, pyramidal grouping of figures, and, most significantly, Leonardo here incorporates lights and darks in the underdrawing of this painting.Even though the panel remained unfinished, the Adoration of the Magi, with its symmetrically composed main group which differs from the traditional linear composition, is now considered one of the most progressive works in Florentine painting. It puts into practice the demands Alberti made of history paintings in a way no other work in its era does. All the figures are involved in the events in the picture. The distinguished kings display their emotions in a more dignified manner than the accompanying figures around them, and the overall number of participants is kept within moderation. The figures are grouped in a circle around Mary and are expressing, with more or less vigorous gestures, their emotion at the first demonstration of divinity of the Christ Child.The painting also differs from the traditional way of depicting the Adoration in Florence by means of the puzzling scenes in the background, the equestrian battles and an unfinished staircase. This led to the assumption that the Augustinian convent of San Donato in Scopeto, which had commissioned the picture, wanted to use this picture composition in order to convey its own theological interpretation of the Adoration theme.",https://www.wga.hu/art/l/leonardo/02/1adorati.jpg,adoration

The present set is related to Madrid on account of a specific iconographic detail. In all these scenes the Virgin's head is surrounded by a halo formed by the twelve stars of St John's vision in the Apocalypse, as if it were a representation of the Immaculate Conception, whereas the other figures display the usual halos of unbroken lines.

Traces of pigment suggest that paint once increased the polychromy of the coloured marble, while the addition of black paste to some drill holes intensified the light and dark contrast of the carving.This panel represents three scenes: the Annunciation, the Birth of Jesus (Nativity) and the Adoration of the Shepherds.The massive Madonna is derived from the Phaedra on a sarcophagus in the Camposanto, Pisa. Her weighty form and Graeco-Roman head-dress as well as her heavy lips and chin are repeated throughout the pulpit with an Aristotelean unity of character. In both the Nativity, where she reclines like an Etruscan matron, and the `Adoration', the figure is not copied but rather studied and then mixed creatively with borrowings from other sources.",https://www.wga.hu/art/p/pisano/nicola/1pisa_1.jpg,adoration

In the upper left corner we can see the Magi and their horses assembling from different directions. In the bottom right corner Joseph is sitting; when the guests arrived he was warming his feet at a brazier. Now, like the Magi, he, too, takes off his headgear with a humble gesture. (If we want to find the prototype of the figure, we could see it in the representations of the month of February in calendars of books of hours: the figure of an elderly man warming himself at the fire was the personification of February.)The picture is a strange mixture of marked condensation and of anecdotal details. The story is circumstantially told by merely putting the most important characters and dÃ©cor side by side. The wealth of small objects set beside one another gradually overlap and cover the whole surface of the picture. The Virgin's canopied bed is a throne too, while its top has a double role and is also the roof of the Bethlehem building crowded with dovecotes. The space left empty by the structure of the bed-throne is filled up by a bastion. Space, as a substance, is not conveyed; the motifs are linked with one another in the way the words of a sentence are.

_art_g_greco_el_21_2108grec.jpg,"This painting once decorated El Greco's tomb in one of the chapels of the Monastery of St Dominic (Santo Domingo El Antiguo) in Toledo. It was later transferred to the high altar for which it was originally intended. This ecstatic painting is one of the artist's most colourful works, which, unlike other paintings of this period, seems to have been entirely executed by his own hand, without the help of his son Jorge Manuel. Light radiates from the Child and the dazzling white cloth on which He lies, illuminating the figures of Mary and the amazed shepherds. From the very outset of his career El Greco had been interested in the problem of light: his early work A Boy Blowing on an Ember is primarily an exploration of the way in which a flaring light is reflected by the features of the face. When he painted The Adoration of the Shepherds, light was no longer used for its own sake but as a means to convey an idea. The words of the Pantocrator are occasionally to be found in Romanesque churches, usually inscribed in the apse, thus: Lux mundi (the Light of the World). In El Greco's picture this theme is now perfectly expressed in purely pictorial terms. The elongated figures, like tongues of fire, and all the indications of enthusiasm, faith and passion, are characteristic of a number of Mannerist painters but especially of El Greco. These characteristic features of El Greco's art are clearly seen in this beautifully realized creation which constitutes as it were a link between the Gothic style and modern art of the twentieth century.In contrast with his earlier interpretations of the same subject, El Greco seems to forgo any attempt to achieve balanced proportions, harmonious colouring and comprehensible space, transforming the scene into a transcendent and spiritual happening depicted in bright and contrasting colours. The bearded shepherd in the centre wears a bright orange-red jacket over yellow-green breeches, while St Joseph on the left appears in a purplish-blue tunic and yellow drapery. Blue and yellow recur in the garments of the standing shepherd to the right, whereas the man on his left wears green, contrasting handsomely with the rose tunic and blue mantle of the Virgin. Against the background of the sky composed of flashing whites and blues, a group of angels hovers above the scene. One holds a banderole with the words (probably added later) 'Glory to God in the Highest, and on earth peace'. Another crosses his arms in a pose similar to that of the shepherd below.This painting is one of El Greco's last paintings, and it is also one of his finest.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/greco_el/21/2108grec.jpg,adoration

_art_d_domenico_venezian_3adorati.jpg,"Domenico returned to Florence from Perugia in 1439 and began to work on the frescoes of stories from the life of the Virgin in the church of Sant'Egidio inside the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. (The frescoes were destroyed in the 18th century.) The roundel of the Adoration of the Magi was probably painted during one of the intervals in the work on Sant'Egidio.This tondo shows very clearly to what extent Domenico had learnt the lesson of Gentile da Fabriano. In a similar way to the Strozzi Altarpiece, the traditional subject is depicted as a chivalric or courtly scene, crowded with characters wearing rich and elegant costumes, all described down to the smallest details. This detailed description, which is evident in the landscape as well, and the presence of hunting motifs are the result of the influence northern painting exerted on Domenico, especially through the works of Pisanello. And yet, some formal and compositional elements, such as the sculptural quality of the figures, their solidity and weight, and the accurate use of perspective, clearly prove that this painting is a work of the Renaissance. The Berlin tondo is one of the works that demonstrates most clearly the fundamental influences on Domenico's art.",https://www.wga.hu/art/d/domenico/venezian/3adorati.jpg,adoration
_art_g_goes_portinar_centre.jpg,"The picture shows the central panel of the Portinari Triptych.The Adoration of the Shepherds, the most important work by the greatest Netherlandish painter of the late 15th century, has a unique historical and artistic significance. The altar was donated to the Florentine church of San Egidio by Tommaso Portinari, who since 1465 had been living in princely style in Bruges as manager of the Medici family's commercial interests. The central panel is flanked by two wings depicting other members of the Portinari family and the family's patron saints, with a grisaille Annunciation on their reverse.From an artistic point of view, the differences between this work and those of the preceding generation, and indeed earlier paintings by the same master, are astounding. While space and anatomy are easily mastered, they are no longer major themes of the composition, The infant Jesus lies within an aureole in an outdoor square, surrounded by his parents, clusters of angels and the worshipping shepherds. The more or less circular arrangement of the figures can be perceived equally in three-dimensional and two-dimensional terms. While the figures may have lost volume in comparison to the Monforte Altar, their faces and gestures have gained in expressiveness. A certain impression of spatial depth is suggested by the figures' varying distances from the front of the picture and by the oblique line running from the Antique-style column beside Joseph in the left-hand foreground, through the manger with the ox and ass, and on through the buildings in the middle ground. Its logic is overthrown, however, as the artist reverts to the medieval system in which figures are portrayed on a scale directly related to their importance. Thus the angels in the foreground are surprisingly small in comparison to Mary and Joseph - a contrast repeated in the sizes of the donors and saints portrayed in the wings.Details such as the angels in their copes and the still-life of flowers in the foreground are executed with an exquisite delicacy unsurpassed in the entire painting of the Early Renaissance.The influence of the Portinari Altar, which was erected in Florence in 1478, was felt by many of the Florentine painters and is reflected in particular in the works of Ghirlandaio and Leonardo.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/goes/portinar/centre.jpg,adoration

_art_g_ghirland_domenico_7panel_06tondo.jpg,"In 1487, Ghirlandaio painted another Adoration of the Magi, a large circular painting for the Tornabuoni family. The date is confirmed by Roman numerals: MCCCCLXXXVII.Such tondos were particularly popular as decorative items in private rooms, and their circular form required a particularly skillful composition. In the centre the childlike Mary is enthroned with her child. In the background, behind the ruined arcades of a classical building, is a simple hut that provides the ox and ass with a stable and the holy family with shelter. The kings' large retinues are lined up right to the ruin, and only behind the Madonna is there a circle of empty space. In other words the composition is influenced by the form of the panel.On the left is a lovely group of four soldiers with helmets and lances, looking in various directions. The soldiers have four horses that are also looking in different directions. Their pendant on the right, further back, is a group of four other soldiers in magnificent contemporary armor. The horses in front of the ruin are also very successful, and in them Ghirlandaio showed that he was also capable of depicting animals with strong foreshortening and from various angles. The contrast between the magnificent gray stallion and the darker gray ass is surely intentional. Above these animals the observer's gaze wanders through the open arched architecture of the classical ruin out into the far distance. There, painted in an atmospheric paleness, is a city surrounded by water and reminiscent of Venice.The composition of this Adoration contains allusions to the unique panel created in 1481 by Leonardo da Vinci, now in the Galleria degli Uffizi. Though Leonardo never completed this work, it had an enormous influence on the artists of his age. Ghirlandaio adopted the pyramidal composition of the main figures, with Mary at the top. The circular empty space behind Mary in the tondo might also have been inspired by Leonardo's picture.A replica of this tondo, in smaller dimensions and entirely the work of Domenico's shop, is to be found in the Galleria Palatina at Palazzo Pitti in Florence.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/ghirland/domenico/7panel/06tondo.jpg,adoration

_art_g_greco_el_19_1907grec.jpg,"This painting served as a sort of prelude to the great Adoration of the Shepherds (Museo del Prado, Madrid) El Greco planned for his own tomb. The idea of a nocturnal Nativity certainly originated with El Greco's recollection of Correggio celebrated altarpiece known as 'La Notte' (now in Dresden) and of certain paintings by the Bassano, both Jacopo and Francesco.El Greco's great paintings, like this Adoration, are ecstatic visions, in an unearthly light, with dreamlike distortions of forms, released from earthly perceptions. Mystics have spoken of luminous apparitions, poets have continually sought to reproduce dream faces in words: El Greco caught the visions of those in ecstasy and the magic imagery of the dreamers in line and colour, in exact recollection of the experience and without assimilation to the visible world. From the moment of the 'overcoming of sensual perception' El Greco's paintings are filled with an optical content which cannot be further explained, which defies all the laws of composition and colour and can no longer be tested by the proportions and optics of the tangible and visible world.Although the picture cannot bear comparison to the sublime Adoration for El Greco's tomb, it is superior to the reduced replicas that was made in his studio.

_art_m_master_francke_becket1.jpg,"The picture shows a panel of the St Thomas Altarpiece.The Virgin is seated majestically enthroned on the red coverlet, which stretches over the end of the poor shed, and her head is surrounded with a huge halo. Jesus extends His hand towards the gift of one of the old Magi who kneels reverentially before Him, but Joseph, sitting on a low stool, takes the precious treasures from the Infant. Looking at the star that has led them, the other two Magi seem to agree that they have arrived at the right place.The space of the representation is filled up by the six figures, or it is rather their massive outlines, which sometimes stand in front of each other as well as their movements that determine the space. The surroundings are just indicated: instead of allowing a view of the scenery, the mountain on the right closes the background from our sight. In terms of composition this is meant to balance the shape of the roof on the left. Thus it is the arrangement, position and movements of the six figures that give life to this carefully balanced composition. The painter stressed all the symmetrical axes of the picture, which is nearly square. The central vertical axis divides the field of the picture into two halves. The three figures of the Holy Family on the left and of the three Magi on the right are arranged in pairs by means of parallels. That is how the old King and Jesus turning towards each other correspond, as do the figures of the Virgin and of the motionless King in the centre and, finally, of Joseph and the youngest King, both of them moving, figures of whom only their half covered profiles and backs are to be seen. But, in addition to the vertical axis, the diagonal lines are also emphasized (see the lines of Joseph's leg and his right arm, the heads of the Infant and of the King in the middle, and those of the Virgin and of the kneeling King respectively). By this the composition is divided into four quarters, the painter having particularly stressed the top and bottom triangles: the former by the direct link between Joseph, Jesus and the old King and the latter by the decorative area of the red background. The regular design of the sky like a wallpaper, and the hill shaped like softly folded drapery, together with the gently gathered fabrics of the garments, which hang in parallel folds, all mark this composition as belonging to the International Gothic style. The various shapes are merged into one another in unbroken curves: let us regard, for example, Joseph's right hand: his thumb is completely included in the tapering part of the reverse side of the Virgin's cloak, while his forefinger clings close to the Child's leg.

_art_d_david_1_adoratio.jpg,"This work, the style and technique of which are typical of Gerard David, has long been attributed to him. After Hans Memling's death, Gerard David came to be viewed as one of the best painters in Bruges, where he worked from 1484 until his death.The narration of Christ's nativity in St Matthew's Gospel produced a whole series of medieval stories and legends in which artists found iconographic inspiration. The Adoration of the Magi that Gerard David painted around 1500 takes place in the ruins of a palace serving as a stable. In the foreground the Virgin, seated on the edge of a manger, presents the Child to the three magi, Caspar, Melchior and Balthazar, who have arrived to offer gold, incense and myrrh, symbols of his kingship, his divinity and his sacrifice. Resting on his walking stick, Joseph stands next to his young wife. The magi symbolise the three ages of life, but also the three continents known at the time, Europe, Africa and Asia. They are accompanied by a large retinue, certain members of which escort them to the Child. The others wait, at a distance, on their mounts. Their exotic costumes and the presence of a camel indicate that they have come from afar. To the right a shepherd observes them. In the distance, to the left, above the town of Bethlehem, shines the star that has guided them.The subject is treated in the iconographic tradition of the time. The ruins could be an allusion to King David's palace or an evocation of the fallen synagogue. Gerard David has nonetheless opted to represent the episode of the adoration of the magi in a wider context by multiplying the figures present at the scene, thereby strengthening the significance and importance of this event. It is not impossible that these include portraits of the painter's contemporaries. The man to the right of the pillar could be a self-portrait of Gerard David, though this cannot be proved. The same hypothesis has been formulated for the man looking at the spectators in the far left of the scene. Gerard David has produced a realistic, palpable and convincing rendering of this episode of Christ's incarnation, in the manner of the Flemish Primitives of whom he is one of the last representatives.",https://www.wga.hu/art/d/david/1/adoratio.jpg,adoration

However, a recent radiographic analysis (1997) has proven that they are original oil sketches by the hand of El Greco himself. The presence of pentimenti, compositional emendations beneath the paint surface, reveals the creative process of the artist and leads to the conclusion that these are not copies but preparatory bozzetti for the Madrid cycle. The important commission, probably designed as a triptych to decorate the high altar of the chapel, was given to El Greco in 1596: work continued until the Holy Year of 1600. The third oil sketch, depicting the Annunciation, is preserved at the museum in Bilbao.The silvery light, the coloristic range based on cold tones, the quick, almost impressionistic brushwork and the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow in this picture are all typical characteristics of El Greco's Spanish manner (1576-1614).",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/greco_el/11/1107grec.jpg,adoration

Given the built-in element of competition, it is legitimate to ask whether Filippino was up to the task. Because Leonardo's Adoration of the Magi was some fifteen years earlier and never completed, a comparison is not altogether fair. Lippi's highly effective picture is full of incidents, although the end result could be considered excessive in detail.One of the interesting things about this composition, jammed with figures, is identifying the characters. Critics claim to have identified Pier Francesco Medici the Elder, as well as his two sons Lorenzo il Popolano and Giovanni il Popolano (father of the famous condottiere Giovanni dalle Bande Nere), and Piero il Pugliese.The work shows traces of influence of North European painting, which had come to Florence with the Portinari Triptych by Hugo van der Goes, while the figures grouped excitedly around the central nucleus are already sixteenth century and are derived directly from Leonardo da Vinci.Filippino draws inspiration here from two other well-known Adorations of an earlier date, those of Sandro Botticelli and Leonardo, both by portraying the crowds that closes in around the divine group, and by including the young man with a characteristic tuft of hair on the right.",https://www.wga.hu/art/l/lippi/flippino/2/5magi.jpg,adoration

The main event is no longer located to one side, as was the case in the earlier painting, but has been moved into the centre of the picture. In portraying such a detailed wealth of variation, Botticelli was following Leon Battista Alberti, the artist and scholar, who had recommended in his treatise on painting that a picture be so executed as to embrace the greatest possible diversity, for the edification of the observer. Botticelli thus not only painted his figures clothed in highly imaginative robes such as present a wealth of variation, but also captured them in the most varied of postures, gestures and facial expressions. The relationship between the various figures here, and between these figures and the action that is taking place, also appears tighter than in the earlier Adoration, nevertheless, they still do not yet constitute a dramatic unity.There is such a wealth of figures in this composition that the overall effect can seem quite confusing, but in the centre is the child sitting on Mary's lap. The scene is a ruined, pseudoclassical temple building. It was considered to be the symbol of the destruction of the heathen world by Christ's arrival, for according to mediaeval legend an ancient temple of peace collapsed in Rome when Christ was born.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Ottorino Respighi: Trittico Botticelliano - L'adorazione dei Magi -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/botticel/21/10adorat.jpg,adoration

Maino comes close to what we now term 'superrealism' in some sections of the pictures. He achieved this effect by careful control of the texture, shape and volume of the objects together with a very cold but bright lighting, which reveals the influence of Caravaggio and the Italian Baroque.The Adoration of the Shepherds is the work of a painter fully immersed in the art of Caravaggio. Maino appropriated not only Caravaggio's distinctive human types, seen especially in the angels and the shepherd in the right corner, but also his characteristic use of light and his love of intricate, studied compositions. Furthermore, Maino was able to fathom Caravaggio's dazzling surface effects and comprehend his profoundly human sense of religious feeling. In the most moving passage of the painting, St Joseph kneels beside the Christ Child and tenderly, almost reverently, kisses his wrist, subtly fusing feelings of paternal love and spiritual revelation. In this work, Maino reproduces the flamboyance of Caravaggio's early Roman style, exaggerating it by heightening the luster and brilliant colour of the exotic costumes, an effect that he possibly appropriated from the Dutch and Flemish ""Caravaggisti"", who were in Rome at the same time.Some aspects of the compositions derive from El Greco, whose works were so numerous in Toledo.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/maino/1adorati.jpg,adoration

The splendid crimson mantle of the kneeling King echoes the monumental figure of the Virgin. That Bosch intended to show a parallel between the homage of the Magi and the celebration of the Mass is clearly indicated by the gift which the oldest King has placed at the feet of the Virgin: it is a small sculptured image of the Sacrifice of Isaac, a prefiguration of Christ's sacrifice on the Cross. Other Old Testament episodes appear on the elaborate collar of the second King, representing the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, and on the Moorish King's silver orb, depicting Abner offering homage to David.The most curious detail of Bosch's Epiphany is the man standing just inside the stable behind the Magi. Naked except for a thin shirt and a crimson robe gathered around his loins, he wears a bulbous crown; a gold bracelet encircles one arm, and a transparent cylinder covers a sore on his ankle.

_art_s_spranger_adoratio.jpg,"Spranger was one of the leading representative of the Mannerist style. As used by art historians, Mannerism implies above all a sophisticated art, fully aware of all the techniques of naturalistic representation but more concerned with artifice than with fidelity to nature. Spranger was appointed court painter to the Emperor Rudolph II in Vienna, and in 1581 moved with the imperial capital to Prague. As Rudolph's art impresario, he designed the displays of the imperial collection - decorative objects, sculpture, prints - which were to influence artists throughout Northern Europe and the Iberian peninsula. Above all, he furnished erotic imagery to Rudolph's taste, silken titillation couched in mythological or allegorical guise.A less familiar aspect of Spranger's work is this altarpiece possibly commissioned by Rudolph and given by him to a prince-bishop of Bamberg for his private chapel. The subject allows Spranger to show off the fully international range of his talent. In the darkened stable we can just make out rustic Flemish shepherds; the dog in the foreground has found a tasty morsel; the kings proffer goldsmith's wares almost as elaborate, and just as detailed, as Pieter Bruegel's or Jan Gossaert's . These touches of Northern realism, however, are peripheral to the almost oppressive magniloquence of the main scene, more grandly Italianate than any Italian's. As their elder bends down to kiss the infant's foot, the two standing kings pose like ballet dancers in virtual mirror image of each other. All three are gorgeous in shot satins, acid harmonies of yellow highlights on red silk, blue shadows on pink. The red-haired king at the right is said to be an idealised self portrait of the artist.

_art_b_bosch_91adorat_10centre.jpg,"The central panel of the Triptych represents the Adoration of the Magi. Several copies of the panel exist in various museums (Philadelphia, Amsterdam, Bonn, Avignon etc.).The panel displays the adoration of the Christ Child by the three Kings or Magi. The Infant Christ sits solemnly enthroned on his mother's lap. The Virgin and Child resemble a cult statue beneath its baldachin, and the Magi approach with all the gravity of priests in a religious ceremony. The splendid crimson mantle of the kneeling King echoes the monumental figure of the Virgin. That Bosch intended to show a parallel between the homage of the Magi and the celebration of the Mass is clearly indicated by the gift which the oldest King has placed at the feet of the Virgin: it is a small sculptured image of the Sacrifice of Isaac, a prefiguration of Christ's sacrifice on the Cross. Other Old Testament episodes appear on the elaborate collar of the second King, representing the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, and on the Moorish King's silver orb, depicting Abner offering homage to David.A group of peasants have gathered around the stable at the right. They peer from behind the wall with lively curiosity and scramble up to the roof in order to get a better view of the exotic strangers. The Shepherds had seen Christ on Christmas Eve, but they frequently reappear as spectators in fifteenth-century Epiphany scenes. Generally, however, they display much more reverence than do Bosch's peasants, whose boisterous behaviour contrasts strongly with the dignified bearing of the Magi.The most curious detail of Bosch's Epiphany is the man standing just inside the stable behind the Magi. Naked except for a thin shirt and a crimson robe gathered around his loins, he wears a bulbous crown; a gold bracelet encircles one arm, and a transparent cylinder covers a sore on his ankle. He regards the Christ Child with an ambiguous smile, but the faces of several of his companions appear distinctly hostile.Because they stand within the dilapidated stable, time-honoured symbol of the Synagogue, these grotesque figures have been identified as Herod and his spies, or Antichrist and his counsellors. Although neither identification is quite convincing, the association of the chief figure with the powers of darkness is clearly suggested by the demons embroidered on the strip of cloth hanging between his legs. A row of similar forms can be seen on the large object which he holds in one hand; surprisingly, this can only be the helmet of the second King, and still other monsters decorate the robes of the Moorish King and his servant. These demonic elements undoubtedly refer to the pagan past of the Magi.Behind the stable in the centre, the followers of two of the Magi rush towards each other like opposing armies; the host of the third King appears beyond the sand dunes. The gently rolling countryside contains, in addition, an abandoned tavern and a pagan idol. Even the distant grey-blue walls of Jerusalem, one of Bosch's most evocative renderings of the Holy City, appear vaguely sinister.",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bosch/91adorat/10centre.jpg,adoration

However, these influences seems to affect only in a minimal part of the classicist culture, evident only perhaps in the figure in the foreground on the right, strongly plastic and with a meticulously studied pose.

However, it could have served as the lower part of a single-field altarpiece.The composition with two scenes depicting the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi is rather sophisticated. The placement of the walls at an angle and the use of this background two divide the two scenes; the alternation of figures in frontal and profile view; and the contrast  of fully lit and penumbral areas attest to a strict spatial logic deployed to create a unified stage setting. The imposing wall is rendered with an obsession for architectural detail and measured by the grid formed by the scaffolding holes. Breaches in the wall enliven the scene by providing views onto the landscape, while elsewhere the wall remains intact and serves as backdrop for the figures.

_art_g_gentile_adormagi_adormag1.jpg,"Gentile da Fabriano's painting is not a geometrically constructed composition. It should be read as if it were the text of a tale, beginning at the top left corner, where the three Magi, meeting at the seaside, notice the star they have to follow. If we follow their course among sloping hills and cultivated fields we can see how they march into Jerusalem under the frame of the central arch, while in the lunette on the right we can see them departing. In the middle distance the direction of their journey changes, proceeding towards us and suddenly the mass of people appears from a deep ravine flanked up by a precipitous rock and a fence. Now we can discern the faces too, and observe the smallest details of garments, arms and harness. Then the crowd, which can pride itself on hunters, noble chargers and exotic animals too, stops at the right-hand corner of the foreground, having reached its destination. Only here does the youngest King's page remove his master's spurs; having sunk to one knee the second King is on the point of handing over his gift, whereas the oldest, who has already presented his, is kneeling and kissing the Infant Jesus' foot. The elegant handmaids of the Virgin are taking delight in the lovely sight.In a masterly way Gentile da Fabriano launches, moves and stops this huge crowd of people. On the shores of the endless sea, underneath the left upper lunette, the figures of the three Magi on the summit of a mountain are surrounded by an atmosphere of cosmic stillness, while the march itself is exceedingly animated. Lively conversations are in progress, the horses are ambling and the limitless wonders of nature attract the travellers' attention. The scene of the Magi paying homage (also in the left-hand side) is calm again, emanating profound devotion and meditation. The somewhat dilapidated gate and the cave separate the principal characters from the episodes narrating what had happened earlier and it gives them some quiet in the otherwise overcrowded composition.The plentiful realism of details which Gentile da Fabriano produced achieved such convincing effects that it approached the Renaissance ideal of representing reality. He was not only able to depict objects accurately, but also every tiny change of facial expressions and the direction of glances establishing links between people. Nor did he forget the spectator, since the donor of the altarpiece, Palla Strozzi, standing behind the youngest King, is looking at us.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/gentile/adormagi/adormag1.jpg,adoration
_art_m_master_trebon_adorati.jpg,"The artist of this painting is referred to as Master of Trebon (Wittingau).The graceful Virgin is dressed in a blue mantle with a red lining and is kneeling on an ornate cushion as if worshipping in front of an altar; she prays to her Child, who is firmly wrapped into swaddling clothes and rests in the watering trough-used as a cradle-of the stable. Behind Mary there stands Joseph, a simple man with a somewhat coarse face. His huge hand rests on the delicate lace shawl covering the fence. In the top corner on the right two sturdy shepherds with characteristic features and in torn clothes listen excitedly to the tidings of the birth of Jesus. At the bottom of the picture they appear again: they have come to adore the Infant. The environment is just indicated: on a terraced rocky ground there is only scanty vegetation. Tiny birds populate the whole scene. On the right-hand side there is a small genre picture with a group of oxen, sheep, a goat and a pig, the latter with a magpie on its back.The painting is a characteristic example of the attempt of the International Gothic style to unite opposites. The noble and clear contours of the Virgin and her ethereal and idealized figure differ markedly from the other characters of the scene, thick-set and cruder, but represented in a more shaded manner. Although Joseph and the shepherds are depicted naturally and without any prejudice, they follow the rules of a hierarchy in their very dimensions. While attempting to convey spatiality the artist also paid attention to a decorative arrangement of the surface. Spatial depth is indicated by means of the layered ground, and the way the stable building is set at an angle. Moreover, the mysterious semi-darkness of the scene also suggests space. At the same time the representation is strongly connected with the two-dimensional plane of the painting, the motifs being placed rather above than behind one another, thus evenly filling up the whole field of the picture. The poles supporting the stable divide the field into three parts and create a triptych-like arrangement with the Virgin and the Infant in the middle, while Joseph is on the left ""wing"" and the shepherds on the right one. The various forms meet in a harmonious way, such as, for example, the elongated back of the Virgin, parallel with the supporting poles of the stable, or her halo, beautifully fitting the supports of the roof. The only stressed line that crosses another one is the white-sleeved arm of the shepherd in yellow clothes and that of the pole supporting the stable. It is needed because the artist wanted to clarify the spatial position of the two figures.

In its original position in the church, it was closed for most of the year, and all that could be seen were the two grisailles of Sts Christopher and Anthony on the backs of the shutters. They are hidden from sight in the present, open arrangement. Back in the 16th century, the triptych was only exhibited on major feast days (and certainly on 6 January, the feast of the Epiphany), briefly revealing the painting in all its glory.This is a private memorial, a painted in memoriam for the donors - in this case a distinguished couple with a large clutch of children. Several of the latter have identical faces, so it is likely that they died very young. The triptych was probably returned to the family when the churches were Protestantised in the 1570s, but since it is not badly damaged it may have been taken to a place of safety by the donor's descendants before the Iconoclasm broke out. Later, when it was evidently felt necessary to stress the noble descent of all branches of the family, the coats of arms were altered, making it impossible to identify precisely who the donor was. Because Jacob Cornelisz's clientele came almost exclusively from Amsterdam, he would undoubtedly have been a respected burgher of that city. The splendid, fur-lined gown (known as a tabbaard) that he is wearing makes it clear that he belonged to the highest civic circles. He can perhaps be identified as the apothecary Claes Bouwensz, who had numerous children and was also one of the forefathers of the family bearing the principal coat of arms.Jacob Cornelisz made nifty use of an invention he had come up with a decade previously. The Virgin seen from the front is presenting the Child to one of the Magi on the left in such a way that he can kiss its hand. The artist had employed that motif in a woodcut in a series illustrating the life of the Virgin. Those woodcuts served as models for other artists - possibly embroiderers, sculptors or decorative painters. In this case, though, he re-used his own compositional device. Sixteenth-century viewers very probably did not spot the repetition, but even if they did it would not have affected their appreciation of the work. The originality of a composition was not yet considered very important, and was certainly less highly prized than the wealth of colour and delicate finish.",https://www.wga.hu/art/c/corneliz/triptyc1.jpg,adoration

When he tackled this last, prestigious and unexpected commission, complicated by the need to adapt a normally horizontal subject to the dimensions of a tall, narrow altarpiece, the aging Jacopo avoided to fill up the spaces with his usual repertoire of objects and animals. Instead, he invented an empty, rarified, interrogative atmosphere, resolving his structural problems with a three-level hierarchy of lighting. Low down, he swathes the now revealed and adored Child in divine light, in the Flemish style; halfway up, the shepherd with the torch provides a superfluous source of natural light; and at the top, the dark is rent by a narrow, angelic glory and a final shaft of supernatural light that filters weakly across the countryside and lopsided shelter.",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bassano/jacopo/2/15adorat.jpg,adoration

Francesco in Montalcino, where the artist had already painted other works. The polyptych has since been broken up, and parts of it can be seen in various museums. This panel depicts the Nativity and the Adoration of the Shepherds as well as an occasion that took place before these events, when an angel announced the divine birth to the shepherds.The Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph are in a cave with the swaddled infant lying in a manger. Behind the Madonna are an ox and an ass, and the shepherds kneel in the front. On the right side, on a much smaller scale, is the angel's annunciation to the shepherds. One shepherd covers his face with one hand, thus showing his surprise and fear, whereas the other hand is holding a bagpipe, an obvious reference to pagan bucolic scenes. The angel bringing the news is holding an olive branch, the symbol of peace and celebration. In the upper portion of the painting, angels have emerged halfway out of a cloud and form a semicircle; they are in the act of singing.As a sign of devotion, the Virgin Mary is represented in a larger scale than the other figures; above the infant are a dove and a star, which serve to illuminate him almost as if they formed the symbolical representation of the Trinity.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 12 minutes):Gregorian chants -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bartolo/panel1.jpg,adoration

_art_r_ricci_sebastia_2_adoratio.jpg,"The artist's bold and colourful treatment of the theme (Saint Matthew 2:9-11) is a link in Venetian painting between Paolo Veronese and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The composition is derived in its essentials from the altarpiece painted by Veronese in 1573 for the church of San Silvestro, Venice (now in the National Gallery, London) and anticipates the altarpiece painted by Tiepolo in 1753 for the monastery of Schwarzach in Franconia (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich). All three works are large, but the composition by Tiepolo differs from the others, which are almost square in format, by being compressed into a vertical.The Adoration of the Magi was acquired by George III in 1762 from Consul Joseph Smith and formed part of a series of seven pictures of New Testament subjects. The related paintings are Christ and the Woman who Believed, Christ and the Woman of Samaria, The Magdalen anointing Christ's Feet (all still in the Royal Collection), The Pool of Bethesda and The Woman taken in Adultery (Ministry of Works, presently at Osterley House) and The Sermon on the Mount, which is lost. All these paintings, with the exception of the present work, illustrate scenes from Christ's ministry.The origin of the commission for this series of paintings is unknown. The size of the undertaking (the dimensions in each case are extremely large and there are fundamental changes in format) has caused the series to be associated with an unrecorded commission for the Royal House of Savoy in Turin, for whom Ricci worked during the 1720s.The painting demonstrates Sebastiano Ricc's role in the evolution of Rococo art in Venice, which reached its climax in the work of Tiepolo. The setting of The Adoration of the Magi is dramatic, the brushwork full of verve and panache and the colours bright. Several changes in the composition can be seen with the naked eye, especially in the centre. The artist travelled extensively in Italy and also worked in England from 1711/12 to 1716, returning home via France. He formed a partnership with his nephew, Marco (1676-1730), who, according to Gherardi, painted the architectural background to The Adoration of the Magi and the related pictures.",https://www.wga.hu/art/r/ricci/sebastia/2/adoratio.jpg,adoration

_art_g_gozzoli_1early_01marco3.jpg,"Benozzo Gozzoli was a student of Fra Angelico who had a formative influence on him. He collaborated in the pictorial decoration of the dormitory cells in the Florentine Dominican monastery of San Marco, which took place from 1438 to 1444/45. There Fra Angelico and his assistants were painting a small devotional fresco in each cell, while Cosimo de' Medici's double cell (cell 38/39) was furnished with a larger wall painting, the Adoration of the Magi (cell 39) and a Crucifixion with Saints Cosmas, Damian, John and Peter (cell 38, the vestibule). The complete integration of the youthful Benozzo's artistic style with that of Fra Angelico has meant that it is only in recent times that it has been possible to identify with a fair degree of accuracy a variety of interventions by his hand, which were first limited to isolated figures or group of figures. Later he had more responsibility and scholars now agree that he was almost exclusively responsible for the decoration of Cosimo de' Medici's cells.Gozzoli's decisive part in the production of the Adoration of the Magi can be recognised stylistically by the fact that, compared t the works of his teacher, the colours are softer, the plasticity of forms is reduced in favour of sharper contours, and the landscape in the background acts as a backdrop. Here the religious theme of the Epiphany is set in a bleak rocky landscape which rises up behind the Three Kings' retinue. This corresponds to the religious mood of Fra Angelico's pictures and does justice to the fresco's function as a devotional picture.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/gozzoli/1early/01marco3.jpg,adoration

The relatively large-size work, which used to decorate the high altar of the parish church of Ortenberg, was painted by a master of the Middle Rhineland, who was influenced by the Frech and Italian art of the period. The scene takes place in front of a golden background, in a narrow space, in surroundings which look like stage sets. The Virgin is seated on a red bed on the left in the tiny hut-small in proportion to the size of the figures-in Bethlehem and, holding the naked Infant on her lap. She receives the homage of the Magi who are arriving from the right. Strangely enough, the shed is attached to the dark rocks, whereas on the right it is directly adjacent to a tower in the town. With a na'ive ingenuity the painter represented the hut as if seen from above, while the tower is depicted from a point of view below it. Thus he was able to give the impression that the latter was higher. Without using this solution he would have been obliged to cut the tower into two and could not have shown the characteristic ridge of its roof. Or else, he should not have allowed the hut to reach the frame-and in this case what would have filled up the top left corner of the picture? Evidently it was important for him to fill up the whole surface of the picture. That is why he painted the jug above the bent back of Joseph, who is squatting in the left corner, and this is the purpose, among others, of the little red table and the bread-basket which is hung on the rocky wall.It is with infinite humility and devotion that the two kneeling Magi kiss the hand and the foot of Jesus. As an expression of their veneration they also take off their crown. The one nearer to the spectator puts it on the large table, a round object rather similar to the haloes, as if he were solemnly placing a gift on an altar. This symbolic meaning of the table is perhaps stressed by the bread-basket hung on the wall above the head of Jesus and which refers to the Eucharist.The frame, like a setting of some precious stone or noble metal, encloses the picture and contributes to its markedly sublime and solemn mood. Indeed, the painting is full of representation of fine examples of the goldsmith s art, e.g. the crowns, the gold sword and the huge, heavy haloes which resemble golden dishes, and what is more, the technique of the painting itself has affinities with the work executed by goldsmiths of the period.

_art_l_lippi_filippo_1460_2adorati.jpg,"From the mid-1450s through the mid-1460s, Filippo Lippi evolved a new presentation of the Virgin and Child that became popular in the second half of the Quattrocento in Florence. The composition and iconography were grounded in two traditions: St Bridget of Sweden's account of her vision of the Virgin adoring the Christ Child lying upon the ground, and early Renaissance Tuscan depictions of the Nativity. Fra Filippo transformed the subject into a distinct devotional image set within an elaborated forested landscape with a rich imagery of sylvan flora, geological features, and atmosphere, which functioned as visual metaphors for the Incarnation, penitence, and eremitical religious devotion.Fra Filippo's first version of this type was ostensibly a Nativity, made for the Benedictine Annalena nunnery around 1455. In this composition St Joseph is present beside the Virgin and Child, the ass and ox lie placidly in the manger, and shepherds look on, while angels bearing the inscription ""Gloria in excelsis Deo"" hover above.Lippi's subsequent elaborations of this type, however, omit these narrative markers: the triptych for Alfonso of Naples, whose lost central panel is known only through a rapid sketch by Fra Filippo and the surviving wings representing Sts Anthony Abbot and Michael, the altarpiece for the chapel in the Palazzo Medici, and a painting said to have come from a cell in the Camaldoli hermitage, dedicated to the Baptist and patronized by Piero di Cosimo de' Medici and his wife Lucrezia Tornabuoni, built in 1463.These images are set in a dark, wooden landscape where the Madonna kneels, her hands clasped together in devotion, before the Christ Child lying virtually nude upon the verdant forest ground. God the Father (or simply his hands) in the Camaldoli picture) appears above and the Holy Spirit descends toward the Child, proceeded by tongues of fire. The Child is surrounded by an aura of dancing gilded flames and the Virgin and Child truly glow with divine light.This painting was commissioned in about 1463 by Lucrezia Tornabuoni, the wife of Piero de' Medici, for the hermitage of Camaldoli.

The peacock is a symbol of the Resurrection. Some scholars believe that Fra Angelico laid out the composition and painted the Virgin and Child and at least some of the figures at the upper right; then his associate and fellow monk Fra Filippo Lippi completed the work.The Virgin is the only one of the main figures in the work considered to be by Angelico.",https://www.wga.hu/art/l/lippi/filippo/1440/05adora.jpg,adoration
_art_b_bosch_91adorat_01tripty.jpg,"The inner wings of this altarpiece are occupied by the kneeling figures of the donors, husband and wife, attended by their patron saints Peter and Agnes. The coats of arms behind them identify the couple as members of the Bronckhorst and Bosshuyse families, but nothing is known of these names which would help determine the date of the work or its original destination.The central panel displays the adoration of the Christ Child by the three Kings or Magi. The Infant Christ sits solemnly enthroned on his mother's lap. The Virgin and Child resemble a cult statue beneath its baldachin, and the Magi approach with all the gravity of priests in a religious ceremony. The splendid crimson mantle of the kneeling King echoes the monumental figure of the Virgin. That Bosch intended to show a parallel between the homage of the Magi and the celebration of the Mass is clearly indicated by the gift which the oldest King has placed at the feet of the Virgin: it is a small sculptured image of the Sacrifice of Isaac, a prefiguration of Christ's sacrifice on the Cross. Other Old Testament episodes appear on the elaborate collar of the second King, representing the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, and on the Moorish King's silver orb, depicting Abner offering homage to David.A group of peasants have gathered around the stable at the right. They peer from behind the wall with lively curiosity and scramble up to the roof in order to get a better view of the exotic strangers. The Shepherds had seen Christ on Christmas Eve, but they frequently reappear as spectators in fifteenth-century Epiphany scenes. Generally, however, they display much more reverence than do Bosch's peasants, whose boisterous behaviour contrasts strongly with the dignified bearing of the Magi.The most curious detail of Bosch's Epiphany is the man standing just inside the stable behind the Magi. Naked except for a thin shirt and a crimson robe gathered around his loins, he wears a bulbous crown; a gold bracelet encircles one arm, and a transparent cylinder covers a sore on his ankle. He regards the Christ Child with an ambiguous smile, but the faces of several of his companions appear distinctly hostile.Because they stand within the dilapidated stable, time-honoured symbol of the Synagogue, these grotesque figures have been identified as Herod and his spies, or Antichrist and his counsellors. Although neither identification is quite convincing, the association of the chief figure with the powers of darkness is clearly suggested by the demons embroidered on the strip of cloth hanging between his legs. A row of similar forms can be seen on the large object which he holds in one hand; surprisingly, this can only be the helmet of the second King, and still other monsters decorate the robes of the Moorish King and his servant. These demonic elements undoubtedly refer to the pagan past of the Magi.The stable and its inhabitants seem to be the source of the malevolent influences contaminating almost every part of the majestic landscape which unfolds in the background of all three panels. Demons haunt the ruined portal in the left wing, where Joseph sits hunched over a fire. The crumbling walls around him are the remains of King David's palace, near which the Nativity was popularly supposed to have occurred; like the stable, it represents the Synagogue, the Old Law collapsing at the advent of the New. In the field beyond, peasants dance to the sound of bagpipes, a familiar symbol of the carnal life. On the right wing, wolves attack a man and a woman on a desolate road. Behind the stable in the centre, the followers of two of the Magi rush towards each other like opposing armies; the host of the third King appears beyond the sand dunes. The gently rolling countryside contains, in addition, an abandoned tavern and a pagan idol. Even the distant grey-blue walls of Jerusalem, one of Bosch's most evocative renderings of the Holy City, appear vaguely sinister. A little roadside cross leans precariously to one side at the left, and the two watch-towers are architecturally similar to the demonic city which Bosch depicted in the St Anthony triptych in Lisbon.The frame of the triptych is original.",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bosch/91adorat/01tripty.jpg,adoration

This tendency is well illustrated by Jacopo Bassano's The Adoration of the Kings. Although he is one of the greatest representatives of the Venetian pictorial tradition, Bassano lived and worked not in Venice itself, but in the modest market town of Bassano on the Venetian mainland from which he derived his name.The painting presents a magnificent pageant as the three kings present to the newborn Child their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The painter's skill in portraying animals, unsurpassed among his contemporaries, is evident in the beautifully observed details of the ox and the ass, on the far left, and the dogs. But these, and the general bustle of the scene, are subjected to the formal order created by the semi-circular sweep of the composition, and by the decoratively repeating patches of intense colour; Bassano does not let his interest in animals and in slices of everyday life - such as the chatting boys and kneeling manservant - detract from the religious significance of the subject. The picturesque ruins on the left, for example, are certainly intended to be symbolic of the decay of pagan antiquity with the coming of Christ.The central figure in the painting, the king in the striped doublet may be identified as a portrait of the painting's patron, Jacopo Gisi.

The subject is set before an array of Roman structures, including to the left the Pyramid of Caius Cestius, and to its right is Trajan's Column.

_art_d_durer_1_04_2adorat.jpg,"The elector Frederick the Wise of Saxony ordered this painting for the Schlosskirche (the church in the castle) in Wittenberg. It was once believed to be the central part of a polyptych, with, on the side wings, the story of Job, in Frankfurt and Cologne. However, this hypothesis has already been called into question. The elector of Saxony then donated the painting to Emperor Rudolph II in 1603. An exchange with the Presentation at the Temple by Fra Bartolomeo brought it in 1793 from the gallery in Vienna to the Uffizi.This altarpiece was probably conceived without the lateral panels, in contrast with the actual practice in Nordic countries, and at variance with the situation of the Paumgartner altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich). DÃ¼rer framed and delimited a large space by an architecture composed of arches of a very refined perspective. The three kings arrived at this slightly elevated space from the back and after having climbed two steps. A single figure, sharply foreshortened, followed in their footsteps from the distant background. Only the upper half of his body is shown where he now stands at the bottom of the two steps. He is Oriental and wearing a turban. The heavy traveling bag he holds probably contains precious gifts for the infant Jesus.The Madonna is clad in azure clothes and cape, a white veil covering her head. She is holding out the infant, who is wrapped in her white veil, to the eldest king. He is offering the infant a gold casket with the image of Saint George, which the infant has already taken with his right hand. This is the only action that unfolds in the principal scene, except for the Oriental servant's gesture of putting his hand in his bag. All the other characters are motionless; immersed in thought, they look straight ahead or sideways, creating the effect of a staged spectacle set with immobile characters.The architecture of the fictive ruins behind the Madonna is beautiful and imaginative. DÃ¼rer had previously experimented with this design in drawings and engravings. The background is stupendous: the limpid sky, in which the cumulus clouds chase one another; the light Nordic city, climbing up the cone-like mountain; the road bending into the archway where people stop, following behind the three kings. These are represented with much imagination and variety, as far as the fashion and colour of their clothes and the differences in their expressions. In the far right are a lake and a boat.This imagination and variety continue in the extraordinary depiction of the kings, in lavish clothing, with their precious jewels, and with the beautiful goblets and caskets that they bear as gifts. It is telling here that DÃ¼rer was also an expert goldsmith. According to the Nordic tradition, also adopted previously by Mantegna in Italy, one of the kings is a Moor. The physiognomy of the young king with long blond curly hair, standing in the middle of the painting, bears, according to recent interpretation, a resemblance to a self-portrait of DÃ¼rer.DÃ¼rer was passionately devoted to the study of animals and plants, which he reproduced faithfully from life. He often distributed these images in his landscape passages, and particularly in his drawings and engravings of the Madonna. We find some here as well: in the foreground, to the right, a flying deer, already known from various watercolours, which here symbolizes Christ; the plantain (plantago major) seen directly behind, whose healing properties were once much appreciated, recalls the spilled blood of Christ; in the foreground, now to the left, on the millstone beside the carnation, a small coleopterum surrounded by a few butterflies, the ancient symbol of the soul, which here may be a symbol of the resurrection.The panel of the Uffizi represents the richest and most mature actualisation of all DÃ¼rer's altarpieces, before his second trip to Italy, and therefore before the Feast of the Rose Garlands, painted in Venice (NÃ¡rodnÃ­ Galerie, Prague).",https://www.wga.hu/art/d/durer/1/04/2adorat.jpg,adoration

_art_p_poussin_2_17golden.jpg,"How Nicolas Poussin the son of a Norman farmer became Nicolas Poussin 'painter-philosopher' in Rome, with 'a mind...as it were naturalised in antiquity', is one of the great triumphs of pertinacity over circumstance. Few artists of his importance have had such inadequate training, or found their true vocation so late. His interest in art was aroused by a minor itinerant painter working in a local church in Les Andelys. In the same year, 1611/12, Poussin left home for Paris. After years of hardship, and two unsuccessful attempts to reach Rome, he attracted favourable attention in 1622 with six paintings for the Jesuits. In 1624 he finally settled in Rome, firmly intent on emulating Raphael and ancient sculpture.Poussin's early period in Italy was barely easier than his years in Paris. As well as Raphael, engravings, statuary and a famous ancient wall-painting then in a princely collection, he studied Domenichino and Guido Reni and discovered Titian, whose Bacchus and Ariadne among other mythological scenes had just been brought to Rome from Ferrara. Not until he was about 35 did Poussin find his own voice, and patrons to heed it. From about 1630, with the exception of an unhappy interlude in Paris working for the king in 1640-2, he mainly painted smallish canvases for private collectors. Out of his very limitations, he created a new kind of art: the domestic 'history painting' with full-length but small-scale figures, for the edification and delight of the few. Seldom has a painter been more intense, more serious and, in the event, more influential.The Adoration of the Golden Calf was originally paired with the Crossing of the Red Sea now in Melbourne. Both illustrate episodes from Exodus in the Old Testament; this painting relates to chapter 32. In the wilderness of Sinai the children of Israel, disheartened by Moses' long absence, asked Aaron to make them gods to lead them. Having collected all their gold earrings, Aaron melted them down into the shape of a calf, which they worshipped. In the background on the left Moses and Joshua come down from Mount Sinai with the tablets of the Ten Commandments. Hearing singing and seeing 'the calf and the dancing...Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.' The tall bearded figure in white is Aaron still 'making proclamation' of a feast to the false god.Poussin is said to have made little figures of clay to use as models, and the story is confirmed by the dancers in the foreground. They are a mirror image of a pagan group of nymphs and satyrs carousing in Poussin's earlier Bacchanalian Revel also in the National Gallery.

_art_b_bembo_giovan_cremona.jpg,"The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the faÃ§ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the faÃ§ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave. While he was working on the frescoes above the third and fourth arches, Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch since 1515. The compositions of his Adoration of the Magi and Presentation in the Temple draw on DÃ¼rer's woodcuts on the same themes. He competed with his northern model in the earthy details Physiognomies are exaggerated; dogs trot out. He applies quotidian, harsh effects.Bembo was not awarded another commission in Cremona Cathedral, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone.View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists.",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bembo/giovan/cremona.jpg,adoration

They include three paintings in the Uffizi: The Ascension of Christ, The Circumcision and The Adoration of the Magi. Today they are mounted as a triptych in the Uffizi with The Adoration of the Magi in the centre. They were given this format in 1827, but the inconsistencies in both composition and iconography indicate that these are individual works rather than parts of a uniformly planned altarpiece. Nevertheless, they were created for the same chapel.The three Magi symbolize both the three ages of man and also the three continents known at that time, Asia, Europe, and Africa.

In his early works VelÃ¡zquez was still strongly influenced by his master; these pictures also reveal a marked striving for plasticity in the figures and balance between the different elements of the composition. He painted The Adoration of the Magi in heavy, dark colours and his lack of experience is evident in the representation of the faces. The main characters are thought to be portraits: the young king is a free self-portrait of the artist, while the kneeling king behind him has the features of Pacheco and the Virgin Mary those of Pacheco's daughter Juana, married to VelÃ¡zquez.And yet, the painting is more than a mere exercise by an industrious and talented pupil. It is true that he has not conveyed the quality of the textiles in his arrangement of the folds of the garments; the composition is somewhat uncertain and the spatial relations are by no means perfect: yet the picture reveals VelÃ¡zquez's genius as a portraitist.

In 1746, his descendant Francesco III sold them to Augustus III, King of Saxony.Veronese places the episodes from the Gospels in a setting of great narrative richness, in which the figures, in modern dress, perform like actors on a stage. In the Adoration of the Virgin by the Coccina Family, it is the members of the family who take part in this sort of play.

An intimation that the picture was perhaps done during Botticelli's stay in Rome can be seen in the groom in the background on the right who is attempting to bring his horse under control; Botticelli probably adapted this motif from the classical sculptures of the Dioscuri, the horse-tamers, in Rome.In contrast to Botticelli's earlier versions of the Adoration, the Virgin and the Christ Child now form the painting's main focal point, uncontested by any of the figures accompanying them. As in the Adoration done for Guasparre del Lama, those present here are arrayed around the Virgin in a semicircle; in this picture, however, Botticelli has opened up the semicircle towards the observer, so that the latter's gaze may reach the Virgin unhindered. At the same time, all those involved, their postures and gestures, are directed towards the Mother of God, lending the painting a dramatic unity which the earlier Adorations lacked. The artist's recording of the figures' various reactions demonstrates once again the importance for Botticelli of Alberti's treatise on painting. The art theoretician recommended for the edification of the observer not only the greatest variation in the possible palette of emotions but also the depiction of people of differing age, together with alternation in the perspectives offered by the figures, who should be presented from various sides in three-quarter and half profile or from the front. Botticelli's wealth of variation in the fashioning of his figures fulfilled all of these demands, yet without losing the central focus of the picture's content.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Ottorino Respighi: Trittico Botticelliano - L'adorazione dei Magi -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/botticel/21/7adorati.jpg,adoration

The altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds is the chapel 's key work  not only in subject, but also in artistic merit. This composition was so successful that other artists frequently repeated it. Ghirlandaio himself appears in the scene, dressed as a shepherd. He is even allowed to come closer to the Christ Child than the donors, who appear in frescoes to the right and left, praying outside the confines of the panel. The artist, who is leading the shepherds, is kneeling and bringing the miracle of the birth of Christ to the attention of both the shepherds and the observers of the picture. His left hand, with which he is pointing to the Christ Child, is finely drawn and is superbly modelled in three dimensions. With his right hand, his painting hand, he is pointing to his chest, as he does in a later fresco in the Tornabuoni Chapel. As Ghirlandaio is pointing both at the child and the garlands on the Roman marble sarcophagus, it is possible that the gesture is saying: ""This holy child was painted for you by me, the garland-maker Ghirlandaio.""The classical sarcophagus in the picture is not just a manger for the ox and ass. It also has an iconographical significance indicated by the Latin inscription along its front: Ense cadens. Solymo. Pompei Pului[us] Augur Numen. Ait. Quae me conteg[it] Urna Dabit. [While Fulvi(us), augur of Pompey, was falling by the sword in Jerusalem he said: the urn that covers (conceals) me shall bring forth a god]. This is an ancient prophecy by Fulvius. The animals' manger will serve as a crib for the Christ Child. In his Adoration of the Shepherds, Ghirlandaio combines this reference to the Roman classical age with knowledge of Flemish art and turns them into an integrated whole.An historic event that took place a few years before this work was painted clearly left its mark behind on Ghirlandaio's work. An altarpiece ordered by Tommaso Portinari from Hugo van der Goes in Bruges reached Florence in May 1483. Florentine artists saw van der Goes' Adoration of the Shepherds as a shining comet showing new ways of painting. In Ghirlandaio's altarpiece, the shepherds pushing their way into the picture from the right, with their harsh, life-like features, are drawn directly from this Flemish model. Ghirlandaio's landscape in the background also displays features from north of the Alps.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/ghirland/domenico/5sassett/shepherd/shepher.jpg,adoration

It was intended for Cosimo de' Medici, who belonged to the community by virtue of his patronage. His room, in fact, was a double cell (Cells 38 and 39), in which the superimposed chambers were joined by a short flight of stairs. Of all the cells along this corridor, Cosimo's was the most spacious and elaborately decorated. On the entrance wall of the lower room (Cell 38) Fra Angelico painted the crucified Christ against a ground of costly lapis lazuli, rather than the bare plaster background found in the other cells. The inscribed haloes identify the saints kneeling alongside the Virgin as Cosmas, Peter martyr and John the Evangelist, protectors of Cosimo, his oldest son, and his father, Giovanni di Bicci.The Adoration of the Magi and the image of Christ as Man of Sorrows in the recessed tabernacle below met Cosimo's gaze once he ascended the stairs to Cell 39.

The two paintings use very similar compositions, of a type which would later become widespread in Flemish painting. The main scene with the manger and the figures takes place in the foreground, while on the right is an open space with a landscape which extends into the background.

The shimmering draperies of Joseph and Mary are set off by the darkness behind them, and are also contrasted with the tattered dress of the shepherds.

A good example of this is the Adoration of the Magi, in which one can clearly see how Altichiero has combined the Giottesque character of the figures with the penchant for narrative detail that is more in tune with the taste of his own time. He does this by directing the attention of the viewer to the retinue of people from the Orient, to the humble appearance of the stable, and to the clothing, with its often contemporary, ultrafashionable cut and high-quality materials.

On the left, Saint John the Baptist is kneeling and pointing to the Madonna. The orphans of the Spedale are represented by two of the innocent boys who were killed during the Slaughter of the Innocents in Bethlehem, kneeling in the foreground. There are gaping bloody wounds to their faces, arms and necks.In this Adoration of the Magi, Ghirlandaio's carefully thought out use of colour is particularly impressive: Ghirlandaio distributes the glowing colours evenly. Mary in the centre is wearing a blue cloak over a red dress. The oldest king kneeling in front of her is wearing a variation of these colours combined with yellow. To the left of Mary, the youngest king holding the valuable goblet in his hand - he almost looks like Saint John the Evangelist - is also dressed in blue, yellow and red. The figure standing on the right edge of the picture wearing an expensive hat repeats this combination of colours, though now the blue and yellow are reversed. In the second figure from the right, wearing the blue hat, the Madonna's colours of red and blue are visible again, and they are repeated in clothes of the bearded man wearing a turban on the left edge of the picture. Between the Madonna and the man with the blue hat on the right, the artist creates a yellow highlight, though with a weaker blue accent, in the figure of Joseph. This row of figures alone produces a rhythm of colour from left to right: red and blue; yellow, blue and red; red and blue; yellow and blue; red and blue; yellow, blue and red.The work represents one of Ghirlandaio's most important ""easel"" works.

Also known as the Landauer Altarpiece, it was ordered for the chapel of the Twelve-Brothers House, which he endowed for a dozen impoverished artisans.In the centre of the painted panel at the top is the Trinity. God the Father is shown as emperor, holding Christ on the Cross and surmounted by the dove of the Holy Ghost. Around the figure of God are two rings of angels. Below them, to the right, are Old Testament figures and, to the left, followers of Christ bearing palm branches. Nearer the base of the picture are the slightly larger figures of the living, led by the Pope (with a blue tiara) and the Emperor (with a golden crown). The grey-haired figure of Matthäus Landauer, the donor, is depicted on the left, being welcomed into the throng by the outstretched hand of a cardinal.The landscape at the bottom of the panel stretches into the far distance. A lone figure stands on the land - the artist, who has depicted the earthly community being reunited with the realm of heaven. His hand rests on a panel which is inscribed: `Albrecht DÃ¼rer of Nuremberg made this 1511 years after the Virgin.'DÃ¼rer also designed an ornate frame for the altarpiece. An early drawing for the frame and panel is dated 1508 and shows that they were a carefully designed ensemble. The frame still survives in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, although unfortunately it has long been separated from the painting. (The frame shown in the reproduction is an exact replica of the original.) Made of carved and painted wood, the top of the frame has a sculpted depiction of the Last Judgment, with God enthroned and surrounded by the kneeling figures of the Virgin and John the Baptist. An inscription on the base of the frame records: `Matthäus Landauer has finally completed the house of worship of the Twelve Bretheren including the donation of this panel.

The bipartite composition can be related to the Burial of the Count of Orgaz, the portraits giving place to the range of angels.

There is a very old-fashioned feeling about the depiction of God the Father, who is giving His blessing surrounded by angels.In this painting the artist was interested less in depicting the baptism than in displaying variation of the nude figure.

_art_p_poussin_3a_1sacram3.jpg,"This is one of the first set of Sacraments, painted for Cassiano dal Pozzo. The picture was the last of the set to be completed, and is quite unlike the other surviving five.Almost as soon as he arrived in Rome, Poussin was fortunate enough to come into contact with the scholarly and benevolent Cassiano dal Pozzo, who was to be his patron for the next thirty years until his death in 1657. Their relationship in its early years seems to have consisted mainly of Pozzo collecting a number of Poussin's first works, almost out of charity for the struggling young artist, as the pictures were indeed of modest pretensions. In the later 1630s the catalyst for a development towards an extreme was undoubtedly Cassiano dal Pozzo, who commissioned Poussin to paint his first set of Sacraments.The dates of execution for this first set are unknown, but they were not completed until 1642, when the final one was sent by Poussin from Paris to Rome. Cassiano owned a Poussin executed in the late 1630s, a Baptism of Christ now in the Getty Museum at Malibu, and it may well have been this carefully calculated composition which spurred Cassiano on to commission Poussin to create the Sacraments, one of the most important single commissions of his career. The seven pictures, though executed over several years, were intended to be seen together, presumably in a relatively small room. Five of them - Marriage, Extreme Unction, Confirmation, Ordination and Eucharist - are now at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, hung in different places in the house; the sixth, Baptism, is in the National Gallery of Art, Washington; and the seventh, Penance, was lost in the fire which destroyed Belvoir in 1816. It is difficult to know whether Poussin worked out his artistic theories after he had solved his problems on canvas, or whether he thought in the abstract and tried to prove his point by painting to a chosen formula. Whatever the explanation, the result was an extremely cerebral approach, epitomized by this first set of Sacraments.In spite of his great rigidity of theory, and in spite of some very dry pictures in which there seems to be little feeling of any kind, a surprisingly large number of Poussin's best pictures are tense with emotion. This is nowhere better seen than in the first set of Sacraments: it is as if all Poussin's energies and ideas are concentrated in these relatively small canvasses.The Sacraments, a microcosm of Poussin's art, reveal his working methods. It is known that he kept a small box rather like a miniature theatre, in which he arranged wax models and altered the lighting in order to help him with the layout of his complex compositions. He then made numerous rough drawings, trying out the compositions until the final solution was reached. It is easy to see that all the interior scenes of the Sacraments are arranged like a theatrical tableau, which gives them their curiously static quality and enhances their gravity.",https://www.wga.hu/art/p/poussin/3a/1sacram3.jpg,baptism

The death of his uncle brought him the then largely unfinished group of the Baptism of Christ, destined for Saint-Jean en GrÃ¨ve; Lemoyne must have worked on this with tremendous speed, for it is signed and dated 1731. The other commission was the bronze equestrian statue of Louis XV for Bordeaux which had been given originally to Guillaume Coustou.The Baptism of Christ is one of Lemoyne's few large-scale works to survive intact, and it is also one of the few successful pieces of religious sculpture in the whole period. Part of its success is in its deliberate choice of a moment of action. It is in effect a group of frozen theatre, with the figures consciously placed in attitudes that could be held only for a few seconds. This vivid, instantaneous mood culminates in the water pouring on to Christ's head, but it is apparent equally in the expressive faces — St John's almost palpitating, wide-eyed and open-mouthed.",https://www.wga.hu/art/l/lemoyne/jeanbapt/baptism.jpg,baptism

Vasari wrote: "" ... a nude trembling because of the cold, amongst the other neophytes, executed with such fine relief and gentle manner, that it is highly praised and admired by all artists, ancient and modern.""Behind this nude, there is another neophyte still fully clothed, in a red and green iridescent cloak. The execution of this figure displays such skill and a sure hand, as well as such a novel pictorial technique, that it almost seems to herald the art of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel.The cold, flowing water of the river presses against the legs of the kneeling neophyte; the water that Peter pours from the bowl, with a gesture rather like that of a farmer sowing his seeds, splashes onto the man's head, drenching his hair and dribbling off in rivulets. Again, as it falls into the river, it splashes and forms little bubbles. These realistic details are not fully visible from the ground.In the past several scholars have suggested that Masaccio must have been helped in this fresco by Masolino or Filippino Lippi (e.g. the head of St Peter, the landscape).

Unusual in sculpture, the scene shows its creator to be gifted with fantasy and a remarkable feeling for life. His predilection for faithfully detailed faces and gnarled hands and feet illustrates a typically German concern for minutiae and didactic realism.

A ray of sunlight fell on the man's head and shoulders, and was reflected inside the small chamber to produce the most beautiful contrast between light and dark that can be imagined. He [Crespi] studied it very carefully and, as soon as he was back home, did a small drawing of the scene. Then he sent two porters to fetch him a confessional, which he promptly installed in his room with staged lighting. He introduced Ludovico Mattioli, who chanced to be there, into the scene of the confession, and painted him so well that everyone recognised him, as they did the priest, who was the same person who had lent him the confessional.' Zanotti further recounts that Crespi made a gift of the painting to Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni in Rome, who was highly delighted and commissioned the remaining six paintings.Crespi treats the subjects of his paintings realistically, while simultaneously making much of incidental matters that distract from the main action, matters which belong more to chance occurrences in a genuine religious scene and not to an idealised one. Crespi dated the Baptism to 1712, giving us a clue to the dating of the whole series.

_art_r_reiner_font2.jpg,"The bronze font made between 1107 and 1118 probably by Reiner de Huy (Rainer of Huy) for the church of St BarthÃ©lemy in LiÃ¨ge. The font is the finest example of a series of objects made at or near LiÃ¨ge. Their antique appearance and recondite imagery typify the intellectual refinement of LiÃ¨ge in the twelfth century; the city was described by contemporary monks as ""the Athens of the North"" and its school was compared to the Academy of Plato.Cast on the font are five scenes, separated by trees, on the theme of baptism. The scenes show St John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness; the baptism of the publicans by St John the Baptist; Christ's baptism, the focal point of the design; the baptism of the centurion Cornelius by St Peter; and the baptism of the philosopher Crato by St John the Evangelist.The figures balance gracefully on a projecting platform and stand out from the background, creating an illusion of space. Some are naked, while even that are clothed retain a sense of the form of the body and of its free movement beneath the garment. The half-length, naked figures of the centurion Cornelius and the philosopher Crato, who are shown immersed in small cylindrical fonts, have been compared to a surviving Roman bronze statuette in Cologne. And yet the general consensus is that the sources of Reiner de Huy's style are to be found not in any actual works of classical art, but in LiÃ¨ge ivories of the eleventh century (themselves strongly influenced by classical examples) and in contemporary Byzantine art.",https://www.wga.hu/art/r/reiner/font2.jpg,baptism

By interceding with Jupiter, her mother obtains permission for her daughter to return to earth for half the year and then spend the other half in Hades. Thus every spring the earth welcomes her with a carpet of flowers.The group was executed between 1621 and 1622. Cardinal Scipione gave it to Cardinal Ludovisi in 1622, and it remained in his villa until 1908, when it was purchased by the Italian state and returned to the Borghese Collection.In this group Bernini develops the twisting pose reminiscent of Mannerism, combined with an impression of vital energy (in pushing against Pluto's face Proserpina's hand creases his skin and his fingers sink into the flesh of his victim). Seen from the left, the group shows Pluto taking a fast and powerful stride and grasping Proserpina, from the front he appears triumphantly bearing his trophy in his arms; from the right one sees Proserpina's tears as she prays to heaven, the wind blowing her hair, as the guardian of Hades, the three-headed dog, barks. Various moments of the story are thus summed up in a single sculpture.This group has often been said to strongly resemble ancient sculpture such as the Niobe (then in the Villa Medici), as regards Proserpina's face, while Pluto's stance is reminiscent of the Pedagogue (now in the Uffizi) and also the Hercules Killing Hydra, which was found in 1620 and restored by Algardi (now in the Capitoline Museums).

_art_t_tiepolo_gianbatt_2_1730s_02rapeeu.jpg,"Giambattista Tiepolo very early withdrew from the lessons he was receiving from Gregorio Lazzarini, an academic of mediocre talents, and developed rather towards the vigorous chiaroscuro of Federico Bencovich and Piazzetta, renderÃ­ng their solutions still more refined and precious by using colours which have an absolutely unmistakable, densely fused luminous vibration to them. At the end of this fundamental experience come the canvas of The Rape of Europa in which the mythological subject is depicted in an airy, disenchanted transcription which at times becomes almost caricature. The severity of the pattern of chiaroscuro loses intensity in favour of refinement of chromatic notes in an interpretation of space open and articulated in depth which is as far from Bencovich and Piazzetta as it is consonant with the taste of Sebastiano Ricci. And the very lively spacial and luministic framework in which the figures take their places with such easy confidence offers a foretaste of the supreme gifts of Tiepolo as an 'organizer' of paintings.",https://www.wga.hu/art/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/2_1730s/02rapeeu.jpg,rape

Her pose evokes grief and guilt, perhaps sexual guilt, ironically referred to in the abundance of the harvest which surrounds her. Indeed, the backdrop of the harvest is treated like water, with the suggestion of frothy waves in the foreground, which for Gauguin represented female sexual abandonment. The picture may be meant to evoke a post-seduction scene, a theme which Gauguin explored to its fullest in The Loss of Virginity.That the scene, painted at the beginning of November 1888, was executed from the imagination and not from life is evident from the fact that the scene is peopled with Breton peasant women whom Gauguin could not have seen for several months.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/gauguin/03/4arles05.jpg,rape

Coypel took part in the concours (competition) of 1727 with the Rape of Europa which, though not awarded a prize or bought by the Crown, was highly thought of by some connoisseurs. It deserved to win the concours of 1727, but the injustice then done to Coypel was remedied by the Comte de Morville, a secretaire d'etat, who shrewdly bought the picture and paid for it the amount the king had promised for the winning work; the ultimate loser was to be the French state.Although Coypel never went to Italy, his art owes a great deal to the example of Correggio and also, it is reasonable to guess, to Rosalba Carriera.

_art_r_rembrand_26group_14group.jpg,"Catalogue number: Bredius 415.The painting, popularly called The Syndics, Rembrandt's largest portrait commission during his late years, is an ideal solution of the principal problem of painting a portrait group. Equal importance has been given to each of the five officials - their servant, wearing a skull cap, is in the centre yet the whole is united by ingenious psychological and formal means. The subtle composition, the glowing colouristic harmonies, and above all the sympathetic interpretation and profound psychological grasp of the personalities of the six men make this Rembrandt's greatest group portrait. The total impression is of delicately adjusted harmony and tranquillity.Rembrandt brilliantly exploits horizontals - a classical rather than a Baroque device - for the unification of the group. Three horizontals run through the picture at almost equal intervals: the edge of the table and the arm of the chair at the left mark the lowest one; the middle one is established by the prevailing level of the heads; and the upper one runs along the edge of the wainscoting. But here again Rembrandt avoids all formal rigidity. These repeated horizontals are broken by sharp deviations on all three levels. The sharpest is in the group itself, in the strong curve of the head on the left. With a kind of contrapuntal effect, this movement is echoed by the slight rise in the upper horizontal on that side.While this style of composition is similar to the relief-like manner of grouping favoured by artists who worked in the classical tradition, there is an increased effect of space and atmosphere by Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro and colour. The harmonies are definitely on the warm side. A flaming red in the rug on the table, which is the most outstanding accent, is interwoven with golden tints. Golden browns reappear in the background, in the panels of the wall, and within these warmly coloured surroundings the strong blacks and whites in the men's costumes have a noble and harmonious effect.The traditional interpretation of the painting is that the men were shown seated on a platform, before the assembly of the Drapers' Guild and that they are giving to the assembly - unseen by the viewer - an account of the year's business. The official seated near the centre of the picture makes a gesture with his right hand which most seventeenth-century observers understood immediately; the gesture was a standard one employed by orators demonstrating evidence.",https://www.wga.hu/art/r/rembrand/26group/14group.jpg,rape

_art_c_claude_3_05europa.jpg,"The painting is signed and dated: CLAVDE GILLE IVRI/ROMAE 1667.There are in all five painted versions of this subject by Claude dating from four different decades. The earliest is dated 1634 (Fort Worth, Kimbell Art Museum), followed by the second, dated 1647 (on loan to Utrecht, Centraal Museum), a third dated 1655 (Moscow, Pushkin Museum) and a fourth of 1658 (private collection). The version in the Royal Collection, dated 1667, is the last in the series and in many ways marks the climax of the artist's treatment of the theme. This is admirably reflected in its heightened poetic sensibility and the sophisticated level of technical skills. Of the various compositions, that of 1634 is also recorded in an etching, while the others are included in Claude's Liber Veritatis (LV 111, 136 and 144), which served as an official drawn record made by the artist himself of his painted compositions dating from 1637 onwards.While the basic features of the design and iconography were established in the Fort Worth painting, changes or differences in emphasis occur in the others as Claude modified his style. It is also true to say that the version in Utrecht served as the basis for the later renderings, particularly in the greater spaciousness of the setting. There is a closer compositional affinity, however, between the painting in Moscow and the present picture, although small alterations in scale and in the number of figures and animals are apparent. For the painting in the Royal Collection Claude most probably referred back to the drawing of the Moscow version made for the Liber Veritatis (LV 136), although the picture itself remained in Rome in the collection of Fabio Chigi (1599-1667), who was elected Pope as Alexander VII in 1655 and was one of the artist's most important patrons.There is circumstantial evidence in the form of an inscription made by a later hand on the back of the drawing (LV 136) that the painting in the Royal Collection was made for Philippe de Graveron. An autograph drawing dated 1670, not from the Liber Veritatis, after the present painting is in the British Museum, London.The source for the story of the Rape of Europa is Ovid's Metamorphoses (II, 833-75). Jupiter, enamoured with Europa, the daughter of Agenor, changes himself into a white bull and mingles with the herd of cattle on the seashore where Europa and her maidens linger. Attracted by the beauty of the bull and not aware of Jupiter's transformation, Europa climbs onto its back and is abducted, eventually being carried out to sea. The description in Ovid is immensely poetic and Claude, by this time well versed in mythology and fully practised in its depiction, successfully expresses the beauty of the text in paint. The mood of the picture is established principally by the chief compositional features of trees, coastline, vessels and fortification judiciously placed within the picture space. The wide spatial intervals create a feeling of calm while quicker rhythms required for the narrative are concentrated in the foreground. The tonal values help to create an atmosphere charged with poetic feeling while the soft breeze wafting from the water is almost palpable. The overall beauty of the painting is enhanced by a number of felicitous details, both in terms of colour and of observation, in which Claude's painting matches Ovid's poetry. The care lavished on the draperies, the flowers and garlands, the waves lapping the sides of the vessels, and the down along the flanks of the cattle testify to the precision of Claude's art in creating a world that oscillates between quotidian experience and arcadian bliss.",https://www.wga.hu/art/c/claude/3/05europa.jpg,rape

His mythological world was more frankly feminine, and more accessible, than Tiepolo's; it hardly tries to astonish the spectator, and its magic is no exciting spell but a slow beguilement of the senses, a lulling tempo by which it is always afternoon in the gardens of Armida. There is no clash of love and duty, no public audience, and with barely the presence of men (Boucher increasingly could hardly be bothered to delineate them at all). But this does not automatically mean frivolity. Especially in the years up to and about 1750, Boucher's own artistic and actual vigour combined to produce a whole range of mythological pictures which were decorative, superbly competent, and tinged with their own vein of poetry.The painting was painted for the avocat FranÃ§ois Derbais who owned at least eight large Bouchers by 1735.",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/boucher/1/rape_eur.jpg,rape

The action unfolds towards the right in the manner of a stage sequence, in successive scenes down to the final plunge into the waves of the sea. The composition clearly marks the moment of transition from Renaissance Classicism to seventeenth-century Arcadia.

_art_r_rembrand_26group_13group.jpg,"Catalogue number: Bredius 415.The painting, popularly called The Syndics, Rembrandt's largest portrait commission during his late years, is an ideal solution of the principal problem of painting a portrait group. Equal importance has been given to each of the five officials - their servant, wearing a skull cap, is in the centre yet the whole is united by ingenious psychological and formal means. The subtle composition, the glowing colouristic harmonies, and above all the sympathetic interpretation and profound psychological grasp of the personalities of the six men make this Rembrandt's greatest group portrait. The total impression is of delicately adjusted harmony and tranquillity.Rembrandt brilliantly exploits horizontals - a classical rather than a Baroque device - for the unification of the group. Three horizontals run through the picture at almost equal intervals: the edge of the table and the arm of the chair at the left mark the lowest one; the middle one is established by the prevailing level of the heads; and the upper one runs along the edge of the wainscoting. But here again Rembrandt avoids all formal rigidity. These repeated horizontals are broken by sharp deviations on all three levels. The sharpest is in the group itself, in the strong curve of the head on the left. With a kind of contrapuntal effect, this movement is echoed by the slight rise in the upper horizontal on that side.While this style of composition is similar to the relief-like manner of grouping favoured by artists who worked in the classical tradition, there is an increased effect of space and atmosphere by Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro and colour. The harmonies are definitely on the warm side. A flaming red in the rug on the table, which is the most outstanding accent, is interwoven with golden tints. Golden browns reappear in the background, in the panels of the wall, and within these warmly coloured surroundings the strong blacks and whites in the men's costumes have a noble and harmonious effect.The traditional interpretation of the painting is that the men were shown seated on a platform, before the assembly of the Drapers' Guild and that they are giving to the assembly - unseen by the viewer - an account of the year's business. The official seated near the centre of the picture makes a gesture with his right hand which most seventeenth-century observers understood immediately; the gesture was a standard one employed by orators demonstrating evidence.",https://www.wga.hu/art/r/rembrand/26group/13group.jpg,rape

It is more graceful, if somewhat awkwardly composed, and has an air of mystery.The Christ is akin to the melancholic long-faced figure in the Passion, but the chiaroscuro in the figures and their grace suggests some Leonardesque influence, if only second-hand. The profile of Mary Magdalene, the elegant phial she holds and her twisting pose are reminiscent of the figure style current in France, which Holbein visited at this time searching unsuccessfully for employment. It is probable that, adapt their conventions as he might, the robust, realist vein in Holbein seemed archaic to the sophisticates at King Francis I's court, who were to find the Italian Mannerism of Rosso Fiorentino much more to their taste in the following decade.The emphatic drama of Holbein's account can be contrasted with the more elegiac quality of light, the landscape, more tempered poses and slighter figures in Titian's rendering.",https://www.wga.hu/art/h/holbein/hans_y/1525/09nolim.jpg,noli me tangere

_art_h_holbein_hans_y_1525_09nolim1.jpg,"Single detached religious paintings by Hans Holbein the Younger are relatively rare in his oeuvre. However, having been trained by his father in Augsburg, Holbein did produce two large altarpieces during the early part of his career: the Oberried altarpiece of about 1520 (MÃ¼nster, Freiburg-im-Breisgau) and the Passion altarpiece of about 1524 (Basel, Ãffentliche Kunstsammlung), both designed in the traditional Gothic style with several compartments. The `Noli me Tangere' is comparable with The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb dated 1522 (Basel, Ãffentliche Kunstsammlung) to which it is close in date and in its own way no less dramatic.The foreground is dominated by the two principal figures who surprise one another in front of the tomb depicted on the right. Behind in the middle distance are two disciples, Saint Peter and Saint John, making their way to Jerusalem which can be espied in the valley below. On the left is Calvary where, unusually, the artist has shown more than three crosses. The scene is carefully composed, with the verticals established by the risen Christ and Mary Magdalen continued by the trees. The dialogue between the main figures is echoed by the poses of the two disciples, whose forms are contained in the space between the chief protagonists. As the disciples hurry away so they lead the eye down the hill and over the distant landscape. The fluid handling of the paint (some changes are visible around the door of the tomb and to the outlines of the Magdalen) and the firm drawing of the figures are characteristic of the younger Holbein, as is the precision with which the green sward in the foreground is rendered. Other features though, such as the sombre colours, the distinctive faces with high foreheads, long noses and small chins, the fast moving clouds seen between the trees, and the luminous interior of the tomb reveal the residual influence of the elder Holbein, as well as of Hans Baldung Grien and Hans Burgkmair.The painting may well have been made in 1524, the year of Holbein's visit to France, or shortly afterwards. Rowlands contends that the Magdalen is dressed in the French fashion and that the ointment jar is recognisable as French faience. In addition, he argues that Holbein shows some knowledge of the style of Leonardo da Vinci and his followers, whose works were represented in the collection of Francis I at Amboise and Blois. Other works by Holbein of similar date (The Last Supper, Venus and Cupid, Lais of Corinth - all in Basel, Ãffentliche Kunstsammlung) reveal Leonardesque elements which in the present painting are most evident in the tension between Christ and Mary Magdalen, the fluency of their movements, and in the treatment of the landscape seen from above. It may be added that the face of the Magdalen is particularly reminiscent of the types painted by Andrea Solario, a follower of Leonardo da Vinci who worked in France from around 1507-11 (compare, for example, Solario's Salome with the Head of Saint john the Baptist - New York, Metropolitan Museum). On the other hand, it has been suggested on the evidence of the oak panel (oak was uncommon in France) that the painting was undertaken in Antwerp in 1526 as Holbein travelled to England.However, there is some corroborative evidence that the painting was executed in France. The picture was not recorded in the Royal Collection until it was seen by John Evelyn in 1680 at Whitehall Palace. Yet it may be identifiable with a picture that hung in the bedroom of Henrietta Maria while in exile at Colombes until her death in 1669, when Charles II would seem to have acquired it. This implies that the painting could have remained in France since the sixteenth century.",https://www.wga.hu/art/h/holbein/hans_y/1525/09nolim1.jpg,noli me tangere

_art_s_schongau_martin_graphics_3nativit.jpg,"In Schongauer's art may be found a transition between the final - and possibly finest - expression of the Gothic and medieval dream, and the first tentative reaching toward Humanist ideals, soon to come to fruition in the works of Schongauer's admirer, Albrecht DÃ¼rer.Schongauer, like DÃ¼rer and others, received his first training as a goldsmith. A man of many talents, he explored other fields and also became a painter of note. Fortunately, a number of his paintings have survived, and documents indicate that there were many more. His training as a painter is evident in his engravings, where subtle relationships of tone and ""colour"" are suggested by the skillful gradations from black to white.In this engraving, The Nativity, the Gothic storytelling element remains strong. As used in Classical times and throughout the Middle Ages, the tale is told by means of a convention called ""continuous narrative."" Thus, if we look through the pointed arch at the back we see the angel announcing his message to a shepherd. The Nativity takes place, not in a manger, but in the ruins of a vaulted Gothic edifice; this allows the shepherds to move forward to the next stage, and view the scene through an arched aperture.Schongauer anticipates DÃ¼rer's love for such details as the vines overgrowing the ruin, the accurately observed plants growing between the stones in the foreground, and grasses sprouting from crevices. The Virgin, melancholy and ideally beautiful, gazes adoringly at the Child. Joseph holds a lamp to indicate that this scene takes place at night; he has eyes only for Mary. In the upper right-hand corner three angels flutter over the arch, to herald the miracle with their singing.Schongauer's mastery of the art of perspective and of sophisticated composition is evident in this beautiful engraving. There is superb control, too, in his handling of the burin, using crosshatching in the dark areas, and parallel lines, flicks, and broken lines to suggest the textures of soft robes, weathered stones, and human and animal flesh.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Josquin Desprez: In principio erat verbum, motet -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/s/schongau/martin/graphics/3nativit.jpg,nativity

_art_m_master_flemalle_merode_2mero_c.jpg,"This intimate triptych, which dates from about 1425, is traditionally known as the MÃ©rode Altarpiece, after the family that owned it during the nineteenth century. It illustrates the moment when the archangel Gabriel announces to the Virgin Mary that she has been chosen by God to be the mother of Christ. The patrons of the painting gaze upon this miraculous event from one of the side panels, while Joseph, busy at his carpenter's bench, occupies the other wing. Campin's fascination with the natural and domestic world dominates his telling of the sacred story. He meticulously renders even the smallest details in an innovative technique combining translucent oil overlay on water-based opaque pigments. The resulting optical effects enhance Campin's interpretation of the Virgin's private chamber as an affluent fifteenth century interior filled with household appointments and goods similar to those that the patron would have known. Yet Campin was essentially guided in his choice of objects by the symbolic needs of the story. The brass laver, for example, signifies Mary's purity, as does the Madonna lily in the maiolica pitcher. As an object of private devotion, this painting would have been integrated into the furnishings of the owners' private quarters, where its hinged wings could be opened and closed according to the daily cadence of private prayers or following the traditions of the Christian calendar.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/master/flemalle/merode/2mero_c.jpg,nativity

_art_m_master_flemalle_nativity_nativi_.jpg,"The Nativity is the most famous work of the Master (Robert Campin). It is unusual in that it juxtaposes on a single panel three distinct episodes from the life of Christ: the Nativity proper, the legend of the midwives, and the adoration of the shepherds.The child and his parents are shown on the threshold of a rather ramshackle wooden stable. The thatched roof has a hole in it and the walls are dilapidated, revealing the ox and the ass, who, untypically for such a composition, have turned their backs on the newborn infant, rather than drawing near to warm him with their breath. The Virgin is kneeling, her hands held out in a gesture of adoration and her eyes lowered. At her feet, the Christ Child lies on the bare earth, radiant with light.Joseph, who had been a figure of mockery throughout the Middle Ages and even as recently as Broederlam, is here presented as a venerable old man. He holds a candle in one hand, and with the other shelters its flame from the wind. In the foreground, on the right of the composition, are the two midwives who, according to an apocryphal Gospel, were summoned by Joseph in a moment of anxiety. Behind this first group, the upper part of a stable door has swung wide open to reveal the three shepherds, seemingly prevented from approaching any closer by awe and respect.Hovering above the scene are four angels. As if exempted from the laws of gravity, they sweep past borne on the wind. They are holding phylacteries, on one of which is written a message. It is addressed to one of the midwives, whose right hand is paralysed: ""Tangue puerum et sanabaris"" (""touch the child and you shall be healed""). As in the art of the Van Eyck brothers, Campin's painting is minutely detailed in its realism. Light is an important stylistic and symbolic element: the candle which St Joseph holds alight even though it is day reminds the viewer that Jesus was born during the night, and that darkness gave way suddenly to light, as the laws of nature were overturned.The most striking element in this Nativity, however, is certainly the extended landscape that spreads out behind the stable. Beyond the two midwives, a rutted track running beside a stream leads the eye deep into the picture space. The track is bordered by pollarded willows and tall trees with fine branches. A path joins the track and leads across a meadow surrounded by a wicker fence. A man and a woman are walking along the path; they are wearing capes and are accompanied by a peasant woman carrying a basket of eggs on her head. Further on is a large farmhouse, its yard surrounded by high walls, and beyond this again lies a village with its houses, a lake nestling between hills and a small farm with vineyards perched on a slope. To the left of these stands a town with many splendid buildings, above which a small castle sits perched on a rocky outcrop. It is winter, but the sun is still visible between two mountain peaks, its ray spreading out from the golden disk in a symbol of renewal and redemption.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):Georges de la Hele: Missa ""Nigra sum"" -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/master/flemalle/nativity/nativi_.jpg,nativity

_art_g_geertgen_nativity.jpg,"This picture is attributed to Geertgen by analogy with works given to him in seventeenth-century sources. It may derive from a lost altarpiece; at this period large-scale compositions were frequently adapted for domestic devotions.The subject of this magical little panel is vision: first, the mystic vision recounted by a fourteenth-century saint, Bridget of Sweden, in which she witnessed the painless birth of Christ, the Virgin's adoration of her son, and the baby's radiance eclipsing Joseph's candle; secondly, the ocular vision of dazzled shepherds shielding their eyes as the angel appears, like a shooting star, to announce the birth of the Messiah; thirdly, the marvelling gaze of childlike angels, ox and ass, Mary and St Joseph upon the Light of the World naked in the manger. And, finally, it makes evident a new vision of piety current in the Northern Netherlands, in which humility is the key to holiness, and a new artistic vision.The divine radiance is not embodied in costly expanses of gold and rare pigments crafted into a precious object. It is made visible to us through Geertgen's patient modulation of darkness, the winter's night barely pierced by distant stars, hardly warmed by fire, only faintly lit by the candle Joseph once held (probably lost when the panel was trimmed at some time in the past). Through Geertgen's mastery of naturalistic description, with only a shorthand notation of thin rays of real gold beaming from the holy infant, this winter's night as it was before the birth of Christ can now be seen to have truly been, as is written in the Gospel of St John, a night in which 'if a man walk ... he stumbleth, because there is no light in him' (11:10).<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 6 minutes):Josquin Desprez: Benedicta es coelorum Regina, motet -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/geertgen/nativity.jpg,nativity

This is the only time the present print is mentioned by DÃ¼rer. It is, in fact, an architectural study; the figures seem quite subordinate to the structures. Although it is clearly designed with a single vanishing point, the eye of the beholder is retarded by the overabundance of detail from following the lines of perspective. The result is a mood of movement in quietude. The scene is not so much a `presentation' to the observer, as it is an opportunity to `eavesdrop' on what is taking place. The eye is drawn to the light area beyond the archway where an angel descends to deliver the good tidings of a new time.On the terrace of a partly ruined half timbered building, the Mother of God is kneeling in prayer before the Christ Child. The form of a praying shepherd can be seen behind, and Joseph, apparently unmoved by the holy events, is fetching water from the well.

Juan is first recorded as working for Queen Isabel in 1496; two years later he is mentioned as her court artist.Juan de Flandes demonstrated a preference for clearly articulated space and refined color schemes. Characteristic of paintings from the city of Ghent, charming narrative vignettes frequently enlivened the backgrounds of Juan's pictures.The Nativity is one of the six surviving panels of an altarpiece from the main chapel in the Church of San LÃ¡zaro, Palencia, in northern Castile.Juan's Nativity, as with many religious scenes, amplifies a biblical episode with theological references. The Gospel of Luke writes that the baby was wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. Here, however, the child is naked and lies on his mother's robe upon the ground, implying that the son of god was poorer than the humblest son of man. The ox and ass, eating from the straw-filled manger, are not mentioned together in Luke. The Book of Isaiah, however, states that these beasts knew their master and his crib. Since a grain storage crib relates directly to Luke's feeding manger, early Christian scholars believed that Isaiah's prophesy was fulfilled when even the livestock would recognize Jesus as their master.Meanwhile, illuminating the starry night, concentric rings of divine light emanate from the angel appearing to the shepherds on the distant hilltop.

So detailed are the figures in their execution and so precisely do the architecture and the landscape match Memling's style that an unknown work by the master must lie at its basis. After all, it is difficult to believe that a follower would be capable of producing such a penetrating, complex and monumental variant in the master's pure style of an existing small composition. The general pictorial treatment is harder and more contrasting than we are accustomed to in autograph works, and leans more towards the Master of the Legend of St Lucy. If it is indeed by that master, then it is his technically most accomplished work. It might also be based on a design provided by Memling which was executed by another painter (in his workshop?). The painting would appear at any rate to date from the final quarter of the fifteenth century.

_art_c_caravagg_11_68nativi.jpg,"The painting representing the Nativity was stolen in October 1969 from the church of San Lorenzo in Palermo, where it had been since it was made. The composition is less successful than in other cases; the contained and pensive atmosphere, however, shows that at this stage Caravaggio associated the idea of advent of Christ not with the joy of Redemption but with a future that was at best uncertain.Under the roof of the stable in Bethlehem, whose side walls are disappearing into brownish darkness, shepherds and saints gathered to worship the newborn Christ-child in such a way that we can make out Archdeacon Lawrence on the left only after a second look, and viewers may well mistake St Francis for a shepherd. One figure, the patron, represents the church for which the picture was intended, and the other, the Order to which the church belongs. We cannot be entirely sure who Joseph, the foster-father, is.The center of the picture is shared out between the figures who have come to worship. The naked Christ-child lies there on a bed of straw and some white drapery. Exhausted, the Holy Virgin is crouching on the ground behind him - wearing an unusually cut dress, which is falling from her right shoulder - looking at the child. The ox, which appears behind St Lawrence, is also looking in that direction. Above all this, an angel is flying down from heaven. In his left hand he is holding a banner on which the words of the gloria are written. His right hand is pointing upwards, as if, by also looking at the baby, he wanted to reassure the Christ-child that he really is the Son of God.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 16 minutes):Arcangelo Corelli: Concerto grosso in g minor op. 6 No. 8 (Christmas Concerto) -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/c/caravagg/11/68nativi.jpg,nativity

_art_s_schongau_martin_nativit.jpg,"In the porch of a house the Virgin kneels beside the Child lying before her on a tattered blanket spread over a bundle of straw. Shepherds approach from the right to worship the Child. Between the wooden posts supporting the roof of the stable we have a glimpse of a hilly landscape with a river flowing through it.In Schongauer's paintings, as in DÃ¼rer's, draughtsmanship is all important. This is, well exemplified by the small Berlin panel, which may once have formed part of a small altar and which, for fine detail, could hardly be surpassed. It was natural, therefore, that as early as the sixteenth century, Rogier van der Weyden should have been regarded as Schongauer's teacher. Although this is most unlikely, as Rogier died in 1464, it is nevertheless relevant to the Netherlandish training which Schongauer received. About 1469/70 he visited both Burgundy and the Netherlands, where as his early works show, he made a particularly close study of the works of Rogier, including the Bladelin Altar, which was then in Middelburg and is now in Berlin.Martin Schongauer was the most important German painter and copper-engraver before DÃ¼rer. In the latter capacity in particular, he won a reputation that extended beyond the frontiers of Germany. The young DÃ¼rer was one of his admirers and was anxious to meet him, but their paths never crossed. Schongauer, who came from Colmar in Alsace, was, like DÃ¼rer, the son of a goldsmith, and the skills they inherited undoubtedly contributed to the fact that both artists became masters in the art of copper-engraving.In 1471, Schongauer settled in his native town, Colmar. It was here, in 1473, that he produced his major painting, the Madonna of the Rosehedge, for St Martin's Church in Colmar. The small Berlin panel must have been painted fairly soon after and may have helped to earn him the affectionate nickname, which his own contemporaries converted into a proper name: Martin SchÃ¶n or HÃ¼bsch Martin.Of the early history of this picture, which was acquired for the Berlin Gallery from a London art-dealer in 1902, nothing is known.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 22 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymns -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/s/schongau/martin/nativit.jpg,nativity

As a sign of the new times and increased demand for realism, space construction has grown more intricate, the building is less like scenery and the picture is crowded with figures. Congestion is enhanced by the great number of characters, many animals, and the scroll containing glorifying words. All these are, however, marked by a cool, distinguished restraint, conforming to the pictorial concepts which ruled in the early decades of the century.

It has been described as the first monumental nocturnal scene in European painting, and it is an ideal companion to the Madonna with St Jerome, also known as The Day, painted only a few years earlier for another private chapel.The artist, following the trail blazed by a number of celebrated works by Titian, interprets a scene that is fully 'à la chandell' and produces an outstanding result. The light appears simultaneously to bathe and to emerge from the Child, who is lying on a rough pallet, only to soften on the face of the Virgin, tenderly rapt in a maternal embrace. They are surrounded by the fluid gestures of the shepherds and of St Joseph, who is holding back the donkey, and by the kicking legs of the angels transported by the cloud that spreads hazily through the picture.Although attenuated by the dim nocturnal light that tones down all the shades, the painting is not lacking in color and the chiaroscuro spreads over and softens every form, bringing out their rotundities and caressing those leaves that are reminiscent of Leonardo and Veneto-Ferrarese painting. It is a picture that points the way toward the future Lombard investigation of luministic effects, and was used as a model by such painters as Procaccini, Reni, and Domenichino, and even later on, by Barocci and Maratta.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 16 minutes):Arcangelo Corelli: Concerto grosso in g minor op. 6 No. 8 (Christmas Concerto) -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/c/correggi/madonna/night.jpg,nativity

_art_m_master_zunk_au_nativity.jpg,"The artist of this painting is referred to as Master of Salzburg.In this picture the scene of the Nativity is represented according to an apocryphal story of the Gospel: the Virgin is reclining on her bed while two midwives are on the point of giving a bath to the Infant. The woman in green is taking the Child from His mother, while the other is taking care that the bathwater is at right temperature. The bath puts an emphasis on the human aspect of the divine Child and is a hint to baptism. Joseph is seated on the right-hand side deep in thought. He holds his staff with his left hand, and is supporting his head with his right hand. The ox and the ass at the manger in the back seem to warm the straw and the small cambric kerchief with their breath.In addition to some stylistic resemblances the painting is reminiscent in other respects too of the Trebon Master's picture of the same scene. In both pictures the composition is divided by the building of the stable, with the difference that here the supports of the stable look like the frame of the scene represented, and divide the surface into two parts and not into three. In both pictures the supporting pole, emphatically placed in the foreground, separates Joseph, who views the events from the back and plays a role similar to the spectator's. In this picture too we can see birds on the roof of the stable, but they are shaped more firmly and realistically (as are the figures) than in the work of the Master of Trebon.In spite of the simplicity of the presentation and the somewhat rugged shaping of the figures with their rather large heads the susceptibility of the International Gothic style to elegance and decorative patterns evinces itself in this painting too. The elegance can be seen in the buoyant lines of the draperies, and in the Virgin's mantle, which clings to her body as if it were wet; the decorativeness in the way in which the painter has used the opportunities inherent in the rustic surroundings, and brought into harmony the pattern of the thatched roof, the mat and the fence, which are made of similar materials, and there is an additional harmonious touch in the plaited hair of one of the midwives.As in a great many other pictures of the period the ground is exceedingly steep here; compared to the figures in the foreground the stable seems to be high, on the other hand the beam underneath the roof touches the animals' heads. Although the white piece of cloth between the two midwives-in all probability a napkin, another symbol of the human nature of Jesus-looks as though it were hovering, in fact it lies on the ground.

_art_b_botticel_91late_130nativi.jpg,"There is no documentary evidence to prove whether or not Botticelli was one of Savonarola's follower. But certain themes in his later works - like the Mystic Nativity - are certainly derived from the sermons of Savonarola, which means that the artist was definitely attracted by that personality so central to the cultural and political events of Florence during the last years of the fifteenth century.It has been suggested that this picture, the only surviving work signed by Botticelli, was painted for his own private devotions, or for someone close to him. It is certainly unconventional, and does not simply represent the traditional events of the birth of Jesus and the adoration of the shepherds and the Magi or Wise Men. Rather it is a vision of these events inspired by the prophecies in the Revelation of Saint John. Botticelli has underlined the non-realism of the picture by including Latin and Greek texts, and by adopting the conventions of medieval art, such as discrepancies in scale, for symbolic ends. The Virgin Mary, adoring a gigantic infant Jesus, is so large that were she to stand she could not fit under the thatch roof of the stable. They are, of course, the holiest and the most important persons in the painting.The angels carry olive branches, which two of them have presented to the men they embrace in the foreground. These men, as well as the presumed shepherds in their short hooded garments on the right and the long-gowned Magi on the left, are all crowned with olive, an emblem of peace. The scrolls wound about the branches in the foreground, combined with some of those held by the angels dancing in the sky, read: 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men' (Luke 2:14). As angels and men move ever closer, from right to left, to embrace, little devils scatter into holes in the ground. The scrolls held by the angels pointing to the crib once read: `Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world' the words of John the Baptist presenting Christ (John 1:29). Above the stable roof the sky has opened to reveal the golden light of paradise. Golden crowns hang down from the dancing angels' olive branches. Most of their scrolls celebrate Mary: 'Mother of God', 'Bride of God', 'Sole Queen of the World'.The puzzling Greek inscription at the top of the picture has been translated: 'I Sandro made this picture at the conclusion of the year 1500 in the troubles of Italy in the half time after the time according to the 11th chapter of Saint John in the second woe of the Apocalypse during the loosing of the devil for three and a half years then he will be chained in the 12th chapter and we shall see [...] as in this picture.' The missing words may have been 'him burying himself'. The 'half time after the time' has been generally understood as a year and a half earlier, that is, in 1498, when the French invaded Italy, but it may mean a half millennium (500 years) after a millennium (1000 years): 1500, the date of the painting. Like the end of the millennium in the year 1000, the end of the half millennium in 1500 also seemed to many people to herald the Second Coming of Christ, prophesied in Revelation.At a time when Florentine painters were recreating nature with their brush, Botticelli freely acknowledged the artificiality of art. In the pagan Venus and Mars he turned his back on naturalism in order to express ideal beauty. In the 'Mystic Nativity' he went further, beyond the old-fashioned to the archaic, to express spiritual truths - rather like the Victorians who were to rediscover him in the nineteenth century, and who associated the Gothic style with an 'Age of Faith'.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 16 minutes):Arcangelo Corelli: Concerto grosso in g minor op. 6 No. 8 (Christmas Concerto) -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/botticel/91late/130nativi.jpg,nativity

_art_g_grunewal_2isenhei_2view_2view1c.jpg,"This panel, also known as ""Concert of Angels and Mary in Glory"", is the central panel of the second view of the Isenheim Altarpiece. In the iconography relating to Mary, the concert of angels can accompany the Glorification as well as the Nativity.The musician angels are crowded into the Gothic chapel which fills the left half of the painting. In fact only three of them have instruments in their hands, and only one of them stands out, a blond-haired angel dressed in pale violet robe kneeling and playing the viola da gamba. His exalted expression and his beautiful instrument, however, fill the entire picture with music. The peculiar position of his hand, the way he holds the bow at the wrong end, is certainly not in accordance with contemporary practice; it is merely a compositional solution employed by the master. Behind him we can see one of his mates playing the viola da braccio, and on the left, behind the column, another bird-like, feather-covered angel who also plays the viola da gamba. GrÃ¼newald no longer makes the distinction between the nine orders of angels, but refers to their former hierarchy by depicting them as different.A long-haired female figure, wearing a crown and surrounded by a halo, appears in the doorway of the chapel. She is perhaps a female saint or, according to more recent interpretations, Mary herself before giving birth. The crystal jug on the steps symbolizes her, and the tub and towel refer to the bath to be given the newborn.Mary, lovingly embracing her child, occupies the right half of the painting. She is flooded with heavenly light originating from God the Father, in which angels flutter around. In the rear on the right we can see the two angels bearing the news to the shepherds. The garden in which Mary sits is a walled-in ""hortus conclusus"" (enclosed garden) with closed gates. The plants - the rose and the Tree of the Knowledge, the fig tree - also symbolizes Mary.This altarpiece inspired Paul Hindemith, one of the most significant German composers of the 20th century, to create his opera and symphony entitled ""Mathis the Painter"".",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/grunewal/2isenhei/2view/2view1c.jpg,nativity
_art_p_piero_3_13nativ1.jpg,"Among Piero's surviving paintings, the last one in chronological order is the Nativity in the National Gallery in London. The missing patches of colour, which might almost indicate that the painting is unfinished, are in fact probably the result of overcleaning.The Child lies on the ground, on a corner of Mary's cloak, following traditional Northern iconography which is reflected also in the features of the Child. Other elements of Northern culture can be found in a few naturalistic details, interpreted in a highly original fashion by Piero, such as the strange figure of St Joseph, nonchalantly sitting on a saddle, or the two animals in the background, depicted with great realism. No landscape view of Piero's is as miniaturistic as the city depicted in the background at the right: even the streets and the windows of the buildings are visible, just like in a landscape by Petrus Christus. Even the composition of the painting is quite innovative compared to Piero's previous production. The wide expanse of ground, dotted with patches of grass, and the roofing of the hut, with its shadow projecting onto the ruined brick wall, seem to indicate an attempt by the artist to fragment the space of the picture, breaking the rule that he had always rigorously abided by. The vanishing point is slightly raised, as in the Brera altarpiece, and gives one an almost bird's-eye view of the spectacular river landscape, which extends into the distance with trees, bushes and sheer rockfaces that remind one of some of the young Leonardo's drawings.These aspects of new perspective composition, of experimental naturalism and even of movement must be read as symptoms of the aging painter's incredible ability to update his art to the latest novelties being developed by Florentine and Netherlandish artists. But it is also clear that Piero could not have gone any further in this direction, for it would have meant abandoning the basic principles of his art. The directions that painters like Verrocchio and the young Leonardo were taking, with their almost scientific studies of action and movement, were leading too far away from the principles of spatial construction elaborated and developed by Piero and Alberti. Piero della Francesca's background culture, still very much alive in this last painting in the group of angels clearly inspired by Luca della Robbia's Cantoria in Florence Cathedral, was the 'heroic' environment of the early Renaissance, created in Florence by Brunelleschi and Donatello, by Leonardo Bruni and Paolo Toscanelli. Compared to the ideals of the earlier generation, the refined and courtly culture which was developing around the artistic patronage of Lorenzo the Magnificent, with its poetic Neo-Platonic abstractions and its archeological nostalgia for the romantic nature of classical antiquity, must have seemed superficial and ephemeral - almost a betrayal of its origins.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 6 minutes):Josquin Desprez: Benedicta es coelorum Regina, motet -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/p/piero/3/13nativ1.jpg,nativity

_art_m_memling_1early2_05nativi.jpg,"The composition of this little work is clearly a reprise of the central panel of the Bladelin triptych (Berlin, Staatliche Museen) by Van der Weyden. It has, however, been simplified and the proportions of the figures with respect to the architecture made more natural. The angels have been omitted and the stable transformed into a realistic architectural fragment, according to Memling's custom, with a spatial function that transcends the field of view of the painting. All the typological and iconographical ingredients of the earlier example are otherwise present. We know that this presentation of Mary, dressed in white and suddenly and painlessly praying to her new-born Child, derives from the 'Revelationes' of St Bridget of Sweden (fourteenth century). The way Joseph, holding his candle, is overwhelmed by the divine light also derives from that source, as does the pillar on the left which Mary saw during the birth and which symbolises Christ's flagellation. Memling also retains in his composition the cellar entrance at the front, which might be an allusion to the cave in Bethlehem where Christ was born.It is generally accepted that the painting should be ascribed to Memling and dated to around 1470. The figures do indeed retain the rather stocky frame and rounded physiognomy of the earliest works. Mary is identical to the Ottawa Virgin, which dates from 1472. The little painting also closely resembles the Nativity in the left wing of the Prado triptych in terms of style. A date of around 1470-72 would thus appear likely.The painting, in all probability, have been the central panel of a small triptych with donor wings on either side, or possibly an iconography that was also inspired by the Bladelin triptych. It must have been located in or around Bruges, because it was copied towards the end of the fifteenth century in a small tondo located in St John's Hospital in Damme.The painting is in its original frame.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 16 minutes):Arcangelo Corelli: Concerto grosso in g minor op. 6 No. 8 (Christmas Concerto) -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/memling/1early2/05nativi.jpg,nativity

Benedetto and Santi Buglioni were artistic competitors to the Della Robbia family.

The two such books that survive, one of drawings on paper in the British Museum, the other, on parchment, in the Louvre are datable c. 1450; both include subjects that range from the scriptural, mythological, and archeological to the fantastic. The books were inherited by Gentile Bellini, who had his father's rubbed and faded leadpoint drawings in the Paris volume retouched in pen; those in London remain in leadpoint.Jacopo's drawings make it clear that he had learned the principles of Albertian perspective without losing his northern Italian interest in a panoramic conception of nature.

Some of them transcended  mere artisanal ingenuity and were true works of art; indeed, some of them were modelled by sculptors who felt equally at ease carving on a monumental scale. This was manifestly the case with Giuseppe Sammartino, a Neapolitan who was deeply attached to his birthplace and who carved statues for many churches in Naples.The deftly modelled and painted terracotta figurines of the Presepio shown here are his handiwork.The grouping is masterly; the dynamic composition perfectly calculated to produce a dramatic effect, one strongly emphasized by the picturesque character of the setting.

Georgii insit' at left bottom.)Francesco di Giorgio's interpretation of the Nativity is more closely related to depictions of the Adoration of the Child by the Virgin. Unlike those by Leonardo, Filippino Lippi, and Botticelli, this interpretation includes two saints on the left, in addition to the Holy Family accompanied by two angels. The event is set in an open landscape, with a particularly elaborate distant view in the upper left background of this lunette shaped panel. Behind the angels, a very simplified shed constructed out of a handful of wooden beams extends from an outcropping of rock.In the short time between the Coronation and the Nativity, more properly an Adoration of the Child, commissioned in 1475 and presumably finished a year later, we see a shift that may signal a new phase in Francesco's development. But the number of paintings that can be attributed to him is so small that his evolution as a painter is virtually impossible to define. The Nativity is a more confident and less crowded composition than the Coronation. The radically twisted St Joseph in the centre, with his active movement, is an ambitious restatement of the Christ from the earlier picture. The sacred figures, including St Bernard and St Thomas (not Sts Bernardine and Ambrose, as their embossed inscriptions added in the nineteenth century would have it) with Joseph and Mary, form a flattened arc in space around an alert, open-eyed Child who rests His head on a pillow, which is formally related to the picture plane.Francesco's treatment of the drapery gives the impression of having been based on careful studies, particularly noticeable in the figure of St Bernard. The figures, all on the same plane, are preceded by a bit of bare terrain. Directly behind the manger, a simple lean-to is attached to an outcropping of rock, with a segment of a classical building in a decaying state. Still farther in the distance is a well-articulated landscape with a local Sienese flavour.

Francesco in Montalcino, where the artist had already painted other works. The polyptych has since been broken up, and parts of it can be seen in various museums. This panel depicts the Nativity and the Adoration of the Shepherds as well as an occasion that took place before these events, when an angel announced the divine birth to the shepherds.The Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph are in a cave with the swaddled infant lying in a manger. Behind the Madonna are an ox and an ass, and the shepherds kneel in the front. On the right side, on a much smaller scale, is the angel's annunciation to the shepherds. One shepherd covers his face with one hand, thus showing his surprise and fear, whereas the other hand is holding a bagpipe, an obvious reference to pagan bucolic scenes. The angel bringing the news is holding an olive branch, the symbol of peace and celebration. In the upper portion of the painting, angels have emerged halfway out of a cloud and form a semicircle; they are in the act of singing.As a sign of devotion, the Virgin Mary is represented in a larger scale than the other figures; above the infant are a dove and a star, which serve to illuminate him almost as if they formed the symbolical representation of the Trinity.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 12 minutes):Gregorian chants -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bartolo/panel1.jpg,nativity

The picture was transferred from Ferrara to Rome in 1527. During the restoration of the altarpiece in 1948, the date MDXXVII was discovered on the lower edge under the frame. This may refer to the time when the painting was moved rather than to the year of its execution.The work is from the mature period of the artist, who was taught by Lorenzo Costa but came under the influence of both the Venetian style of the Bellini and the classicism of Raphael. The brush-work is similar to that of the Deposition in the Galleria di Capodimonte in Naples, dating from 1521, and the St Margaret in Copenhagen, painted in 1524. In both these works we find the same sharp and limpid treatment of volumes, as well as the pure and simple forms of the monumental figures in the foreground, together with a delicate colouring that tends toward transparent shades of blue, green, and yellow in the backgrounds.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Michael Praetorius: Motet -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/o/ortolano/nativity.jpg,nativity

_art_b_baldung_2_08nativi.jpg,"An idyllic representation of the frequently painted subject from one of the most peculiar German Renaissance artists.By electing to portray the main figures simply and quietly at the back of the stable, Baldung draws the eye first to the ruined architecture and the ox and ass seen in larger scale on the left. His construction of the interior embraces the opposite poles of precise foreshortening - as in the incisively drawn plynth in the foreground - and perspective uncertainty, something heightened by the differences in scale between animals and the figures. Viewer irritation and Mannerist alienation are quite clearly not the artist's aims, however.With the help of painted light, whose source seems to lie beyond the natural world, Baldung portrays the miracle of the Holy Night with what is for him an unusual depth of feeling. The infant Jesus, held in his swaddling bands by putti, seems to radiate light onto Joseph's red coat and Mary's hands and face. Through the brick archway in the cracked, plastered wall, we glimpse a second miraculous vision: an angel encircled by a radiant glory is appearing to a shepherd watching his flock. The fusion of light and shade and the soft modulation of the contours suggest that Baldung may have come into contact with the Danube School.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Michael Praetorius: Motet -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/baldung/2/08nativi.jpg,nativity

_art_j_juan_1_virgin_c.jpg,"The composition of this remarkably refined little painting is based on a lost small work by Memling, which is best reflected in the Virgin of the Metropolitan Museum, New York. Since the dimensions correspond, the work must have been done with a tracing or punch-cardboard based on the original. The version discussed here shows the image in the right direction. The Virgin is represented high above a landscape, more monumental than the prototype. She stands behind a wall over which a white cloth is draped with very heavy folds. This also differs from the model. The panel was incorrectly ascribed to Michel Sittow, and later attributed to Juan de Flandes in 1966. On account of the quality, the typical facial features and the vaporous green-grey landscape, this attribution cannot be doubted. The panel originated about the time of the Retablo Mayor of Palencia (c. 1510) and may have been the central panel of a small triptych described in the accounts of Palencia Cathedral as the 'tabla oratorio de tress pieÃ§as'. If so, it could have been a work in the style of Memling's Triptych of Benedetto Portinari (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi), with a donor and a saint in front of a continuous landscape on the wings.",https://www.wga.hu/art/j/juan/1/virgin_c.jpg,virgin and child

_art_m_memling_5late_37frag2.jpg,"A number of correspondences, including dimensions, origins and inscriptions prove that the three fragments In Bucharest (the Standing Virgin and Child and the two panels with donors) belong together. They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side. If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm.The Virgin is represented in an unusual portal construction, flanked by two brown marble columns, supporting wooden beams. She stands with the Christ Child on her arm before a cloth of honour in red and black brocade. The construction runs obliquely to the left, with the Virgin turned frontally towards the painter. This shifting of the viewpoint relative to the painting's axis was a favourite perspective effect of Memling's.The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date. Similar triangular pieces have also been inserted to the left and right of the woman. Like the horizontal strip above the heads in both panels, these additions (to replace damaged or sawn-out sections?) were already present in 1656, when the panels were part of the collection of Leopold Wilhelm.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/memling/5late/37frag2.jpg,virgin and child

With the death of the pope in 1623 he returned to Cento, where he pursued a successful career providing easel paintings to clients throughout Europe. He resisted offers from the French and English kings to work at their courts. After the death of Reni he moved to Bologna where he became the leading painter. In the best works from this late period of his life, he contrived to emulate Reni's cool elegance without compromising his own gifts as both colourist and draughtsman.This painting was commissioned in 1649 by Francesco I d'Este to replace Correggio's Madonna with St George in the church San Pietro Martire in Modena.

_art_m_master_flemalle_2_virgin2.jpg,"Like the Virgin and Child before a Firescreen (in the same museum), the picture shows the Virgin Mary in a cosy domestic setting. She has either just bathed, or is about to bathe, the Christ Child in front of the fire. The scene corresponds to no passage in the Gospels, but is inspired by the devotional literature which was widely current in the Netherlands at the time. We are invited to marvel at the humility of Mary, a modest - if surprisingly well-to-do - townswoman; at her maternal devotion - she does not rely on a nursemaid to care for her child; and at the tender affection between her and her son. More profoundly, we are led to reflect on the Incarnation: Christ has truly become man, touching his genitals like like any baby boy. His mother is without doubt the Virgin, for she wears her hair loose like an unmarried girl or a queen at her coronation. Haloes radiate from both their heads. The lighted candle may symbolise the marriage candle, for she is not only the Mother, but also the Bride of Christ.Through the refined manipulation of thin layers of translucent oil paint, the artist is able to depict three light sources - the window, the sparking fire and the steadily burning candle - and the surface textures of many different materials, from the gleaming metal of the water basin to the velvet brocade of cushions and bench covering. Almost more magically, he is able to evoke the distant sky through the open window and through the small leaded glass panes above. These wonderful details were surely meant to capture and hold the close attention of the viewer, and lead him or her (and perhaps more particularly her) effortlessly to meditate on the spiritual values embodied here.The painting was probably executed by the workshop of the Master of FlÃ©malle (Robert Campin).

Here however, creeping into view from behind, we see St John making direct eye contact with us, cheekily imploring us to remain quiet for fear of awakening his young cousin who sleeps cradled against his mother's bosom.

At one time he was known only as the Master of the Death of the Virgin, after a large altar in Cologne, and, since there were several painters surnamed van Cleve, his pictures have often been confused with their work.Joos was born in Bruges in the 1480s and worked in Antwerp from 1511 onwards. His altar-pieces and portraits were known and appreciated beyond the boundaries of the Netherlands, and he spent some time as a portrait painter at the court of Francis I, King of France. He was influenced by Leonardo and the Italian Renaissance painters, but in his religious compositions he mostly adhered to the great tradition of early Netherlandish painting handed down from Van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. This half-length Madonna is a late Gothic type, frequently found also in Memling's works. She faces the spectator and gives to her Child a glass of red wine symbolic of the Redemption.

Formerly the panel was attributed to an anonymous Florentine painter of the second half of the fifteenth century under the influence of contemporary German art. However, now the panel is recognized  as Bavarian and is assigned to the Master of the Munich Marian panels, a master probably active in Munich in the mid-fifteenth century, named after an Annunciation and a Nativity in the Kunsthaus, Zurich.

_art_m_master_zunk_ge_zunk_ge8_65anne.jpg,"Although it was not declared a dogma until 1854, the belief that the Virgin Mary was conceived without sin, sine macula, was already widely spread in the Middle Ages. This explains the special devotion for her parents, Anne and Joachim (not mentioned in the Bible), reflected in numerous works of art of the period. Besides the representations of the meeting between Anne and Joachim beneath the Golden Gate and of the birth of the Blessed Virgin, images with St Anne holding her daughter Mary and her grandson Jesus Christ have been documented in Germany as early as the 13th century. Seated images initially prevailed, but numerous standing figures like this sculpture were produced in the 15th century and early 16th century. The context of this kind of works was usually simple; nevertheless, this one seems to have been placed alongside other figures on an altarpiece box.The sculpture is designed to be viewed from the front; it has a hollow back, which reduces both its weight and the risk of cracks in the wood; the old beautiful polychromy obeys the same purpose. Despite having been partially restored at a later date, it still preserves its original appearance. Most outstanding are the remains of the imitation of a rich brocade with gold thread achieved by applying fine sheets of embossed metal.The original provenance of the work is unknown, but its style suggests it came from Ulm, the most important art centre in 15th-century Swabia. This figure of St Anne seems to have been made by an artist in Niklaus Weckmann's circle. Weckmann's large and prolific workshop was the main centre of sculpture production in Ulm in the first decades of the 16th century.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/master/zunk_ge/zunk_ge8/65anne.jpg,virgin and child

(Anna metterza: St Anne with the Virgin and Child.) Leonardo must have chosen this unusual theme for symbolic reasons, which have been variously interpreted. Sigmund Freud made out the shape of a vulture in the Virgin's garment, and suggested a psychoanalytical explanation: since as a child Leonardo dreamt that he had been attacked in his cradle by a vulture.There is a cartoon in the National Gallery in London by Leonardo of the same subject but differing in important respects from the Louvre painting. We know from a letter that Leonardo made another cartoon, now lost. The painting was commissioned by the Servites in Florence. It is unfinished; perhaps it was abandoned because of the artist's sudden interest in mathematics, and his engagement as engineer in the service of Cesare Borgia. Another hand seems to have finished the lamb which he had perhaps only sketched in; the landscape, St Anne, the Virgin and the Child Christ are the work of Leonardo himself. The paint is applied thinly, it is limpid and transparent, so that in some places the underlying sketch is visible.

Gentile's sumptuous decorative effects can now best be appreciated in the gold brocade, for the once-brilliant cloth of honour behind the Virgin and Child, painted translucent red over silver leaf and green over gold, has darkened and blotched with age.Despite its regal magnificence, the central group retains a graceful intimacy. The Virgin, an ideal beauty of her day with fair hair, broad forehead and rosebud mouth, looks out gravely as the Christ Child smiles contentedly, showing his tiny milk teeth. Keeping firm hold of his mother's cloak, he turns from her to the adoring angel, with a daisy - symbol of his innocence, picked in Heaven, the garden of eternal spring - held daintily between his pudgy finger and thumb.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/gentile/quarate/02quarat.jpg,virgin and child

_art_m_master_zunk_hu_zunk_hu1_09stanne.jpg,"The painting originates from Eperjes.In a votive picture donated by Senator JÃ¡nos HÃ¼tter this subject is fully represented: the painter also included portraits of the donor and his sons. Behind him his patron saint, John the Evangelist, is seen standing with his right arm resting on the shoulder of the praying figure. Another rare addition is the figure of St. Joseph behind the Virgin. The interior may have been inspired by a DÃ¼rer print: the spacious effect produced by the barrel vault and the ample use of Renaissance style architectural decorative element were surely meant to create an atmosphere of solemnity. The balusters of the terrace railing closely resemble those of the outside staircase of the Town Hall in BÃ¡rtfa, completed in 1509 and considered a novelty in the whole neighbourhood at that time.The main motif of the skilfully painted landscape in the background, namely the mill to which people are seen carrying corn for grinding, is evidently not just a charming genre scene but is also of symbolic significance. Just as the corn has to be ground between mill-stones to make flour which thus is the basis of the bread for the Eucharist, so Jesus, held with anxious care and great reverence between the two saintly women and touched by them only through a clean white veil, has to die a bitter and painful death to bring about the redemption of mankind.The panel is strikingly Augsburgian in style, for it aspires to a very Italianate appearance which the master tries to attain with his putti, architectural details and other small motifs. The face of the Senator recalls DÃ¼rer's Fugger portrait. This odd resemblance may be due to the fact that the ThurzÃ³-Fugger mining and trading company was at the height of its power and activity in those years and it may have been through this family that the master was subjected to this otherwise rare artistic influence.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/master/zunk_hu/zunk_hu1/09stanne.jpg,virgin and child

_art_m_master_yunk_fr_yunk_fr1_07wilton.jpg,"This is the right panel of the Wilton Diptych (named after the house in which it was preserved), the finest work in England in the International Gothic style. Although it is a painting of extraordinary beauty and must be from the hand of an artist of the highest rank, critics disagree as to whether  he was English, French or Italian.St Edmund, king and martyr, St Edward the Confessor and St John the Baptist present the kneeling monarch Richard II of England in the left panel to the azure assembly of the Virgin and Child, attended by angels, on the right panel. The left scene is set in an earthly forest, the right in the flowering garden of heaven.The artist, who was probably one of the king's painters, has lavished more care on the delineation of the personal emblems and insignia of the king than on his actual personality. There was no need for the latter, since this donor image was meant for the eyes of the donor himself. The monarch wears around his neck the white hart badge which Richard adopted in 1390 as his personal insignia. It reappears on the reverse of the left panel. Both it and the French insignia of broom-cods (seed-pods) are woven into the king's iridescent gold mantle. The white hart badge is also worn by each of the eleven angels, who thus become royal retainers. One of them holds the banner of St George. The event commemorated here has been conjectured as Richard's coronation in 1377, his seeking divine sanction for a crusade in the mid-1990s, or his meeting with the French king in 1396.But need it refer to a specific historical moment? Surely it is an outstanding example of a private image, a portable diptych that would follow the king on his travels.

The depiction of the space with the view to the side through an arch is reminiscent of Flemish models, but the figural conception and monumental triangular composition of the group of figures also relates to Italy, in particular to the Madonna paintings by Giovanni Bellini. The picture dates either from DÃ¼rer's visit to Venice in 1494-5 or soon afterwards in Nuremberg.

He probably came from Haarlem, and learned his artist's trade in the Southern Netherlands where he was strongly influenced by Rogier van der Weyden.

_art_h_holbein_hans_e_virgin_3.jpg,"This small devotional panel depicts the very tender scene of the Virgin and Child with St Anne, a subject that had been popular in Germany from the 14th century onwards. The Christ Child, seated between the Virgin and St Anne, seems quite independent although perhaps somewhat precariously balanced as he reaches for the Virgin's prayer book with his right hand. The three figures are all seated on an elaborate golden throne; its base is a barbed quatrefoil, a common motif in Gothic architectural design, which is strewn with roses. Two flying angels hold up a cloth behind the Infant while above his head flutters the Dove of the Holy Spirit.The influence of the sculptor Nicolaus Gerhaert on Holbein's overall conception of the subject is noted. In Gerhaert's Virgin and Child with St Anne we see a similar sense of freedom in the depiction of the Child, who leans away from the Virgin to reach St Anne, as well as that same element of instability, as if in his enthusiasm, he might well topple over. The figures, too, with their thin, elegant bodies, large heads, and the sharp, well-defined folds of the drapery look back to the late Gothic style that characterizes Gerhaert's sculpture.

Beside them and further back are two medical saints, Cosma and Damian, one of whom is holding a spatula and the other a pharmaceutical jar. The presence of these is due to the dedication of the altar, but there may also have been a personal meaning for Lotto. He was recovering from an illness between August and December 1546 when working on the altarpiece. Signs of this may perhaps also be found in the painting itself, with its simplification and poverty of inspiration, favouring the mystical moment typical of popular piety.

She tenderly offers Him some grapes, while behind them the sunlit landscape spreads out past a single tree, leading across lakeside houses and bridges and pastures towards a distant hill top castle.Stylistically, this painting has always been closely associated with the work of Lucas Cranach the Elder, and there can be little doubt that its author must have been closely acquainted with his work and may well have trained in his workshop. Iconographically the composition, with the Virgin seated full-length in a landscape, was derived in German art from the earlier work of Martin Schongauer and particularly Albrecht DÃ¼rer, who had both explored the theme in a series of woodcuts and engravings from the 1480s onwards.This painting was part of the Barbara Piasecka Johnson Collection, and after the death of the collector it was sold through Sotheby's in July 2014.

He worked across much of northern Italy, finding employment in Modena, Cremona, Pavia and Genoa, where he assimilated a broad range of styles.This lyrical, small-scale devotional picture would have been intended as an aid to prayer and contemplation: it shows the infant Saint John holding up a lamb before the Holy Family, representing Christ's future sacrifice.

_art_m_master_zunk_fl_15_paint_2_07virgin.jpg,"The Virgin is carrying the naked Infant Christ, who is sitting on a cloth, in both hands. She is in front of a wall-hanging in red-gold brocade and is clothed in a dark blue garment with a grey fur lining and a mantle of the same colour (in fact it has darkened into blue-green). With his left hand the Child reaches for the hanger of a necklace made of red coral (possibly an allusion to the blood of his sacrifice), and in his other hand he holds a pear (as the fruit of the `new Adam', an allusion to Salvation). The Virgin is situated in front of a golden balustrade with an arcade of rounded arches which encloses the choir of a church with stained-glass windows. She appears behind a golden arch resting on brown marble pillars. The image should probably be interpreted as a Virgin who is standing behind a low wall supporting an arch. The top of this little wall was originally probably visible and seems to have been sawn off.This Virgin-and-Child type is frequently encountered in works by Memling and his followers, sometimes with the Child sitting on the wall. Related examples by Memling are: the Van Nieuwenhove Virgin (Memlingmuseum, Bruges); the Virgin and Child in Lisbon (Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga). A similar type by a Memling follower is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.The little work discussed here is also Memlingian from a stylistic point of view. The type of the Virgin with the bulging forehead, the long straight nose and the narrow bow-shaped eyebrows is particularly closely related to Memling. The faces, however, are flatter and squarer, especially in the case of the Child.

The painting was commissioned by Fabrizio Sergardi, a Sienese nobleman, and was left uncompleted by the artist. Nevertheless, it is signed and dated. According to tradition it was finished by Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, although the recent restoration would seem to contradict this attribution. It was subsequently acquired by Francis I of France. The painting is known primarily for the harmonic and proportional balancing of the poses of the figures and for the high formal quality present in every element, particularly in the face of the Virgin, which served as a model of beauty for generations of artists.This painting is the highpoint of all Raphael's Florentine Madonnas. The bodies occupy the space with great freedom, while the figures interact with deep feeling. The arch formed by the frame completes the composition harmoniously.

After having passed from collection to collection, it was acquired in 1910 by Benjamin Altmann, who donated it in 1913 to the museum in New York.After having formerly been considered at times a copy, today the panel is generally held to be an original work of DÃ¼rer. The theme treated is often found in the altarpieces in Nuremberg, which are obviously of different scales and are solemn and monumental. Here the close and more familiar rapport the patron had with the requested painting led DÃ¼rer to prefer a more intimate interpretation.DÃ¼rer's work is triangular in composition. St Anne, the mother of the Virgin, places her left hand on her daughter's shoulder, in a gesture of consolation. The youthful Mary worships the child, her hands together in silent prayer. The infant rests against St Anne. His expression suggests not only sleep, but death, as the two women seem to understand. A study survives of the half length figure of St Anne, probably based on DÃ¼rer's wife Agnes, then in her mid-forties. In the painting, St Anne's features have been softened and she appears younger.

_art_v_vivarini_alvise_sacra_co.jpg,"The heavy plasticity of Bartolomeo Vivarini and Andrea da Murano was soon surpassed by the more balanced and harmonious three-dimensional quality of the works of Antonello da Messina. His St Cassiano altarpiece of 1476, fragments of which are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was studied and admired by a whole generation of painters. One of the first to be inspired by it was Alvise Vivarini, son of Antonio and follower of his uncle Bartolomeo, who soon went on to become a major exponent of Antonello's theories of crystalline form and colour. His major work coming from the first and much-admired studio of Messina is the Sacra Conversazione dated 1480, originally in the church of San Francesco in Treviso.The painting is composed with geometrical symmetry: the two groups of saints, Louis of Toulouse, Anthony of Padua and Anne on the left and Joachim, Bernardino and Francesco Gioacchino on the right, face inwards towards the enthroned Virgin. In their gestures immobilized by the cold light which comes from the top left-hand corner, the three-dimensional figures appear to form a kind of architecture the centre of which is the throne, a construction of cylinders and parallelepipeds, behind which the curtain falls heavily excluding from sight all natural elements apart from two small fragments of a cold, clouded sky. Shadows appear to cut into the floor, confirmation of the geometrical relationship between space and figures, while the clear line delineates areas of pure enamel-like colour. This theory of formal abstraction was to become during the last few years of the 15th century still more monumental, in contrast to the ideas of colourization and sublime naturalness represented by Giovanni Bellini.Recent examination has revealed that the green curtain in the background was added at a later date.

All three paintings have compositional affinities with Raphael, particularly works such as the Madonna del Granduca, the Madonna Tempi and the large Cowper Madonna. Dyce made a number of preparatory studies for the Virgin and Child and in a surprisingly wide variety of media - drawings, watercolours, oil and apparently even fresco, although this last item may be the painting on slate in Nottingham.The painting in the Royal Collection was acquired by Prince Albert in 1845. The pleasure that the Virgin and Child gave to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert resulted in the commission a year later of Saint Joseph to form a pair.

Both pictures were hung after Prince Albert's death in the Queen's Bedroom at Osborne House, Isle of Wight.

The angel plucking the strings of his lute with a lightly bent feather is wearing a cloak with an elaborate ornamental pattern obviously derived from garments seen on the most stylishly apparelled notabilities, while the silky locks of all the figures falling in rich curls bear evidence of the high standards of hair-dressing in that age.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/master/zunk_ge/zunk_ge4a/virgin_c.jpg,virgin and child

_art_m_memling_3mature2_21virgi.jpg,"Little attention was focused on this work until recently, despite the fact that it is a fairly well-preserved painting of high quality. It differs from the artist's other enthroned Virgins in its notably larger format, and iconographically simpler, less ornate decoration. Seated on a straight, wooden bench that stands on a bare tile floor, with no Oriental carpet, this Virgin still recalls the humble domestic atmosphere of compositions by the Master of FlÃ©malle and Rogier van der Weyden. The position of the Child in his mother's hands is somewhat reminiscent in type of Hugo van der Goes' little painting of the Virgin in Frankfurt (Städelsches Kunstinstitut). The origins of this type are to be found in the FlÃ©malle circle, which means that Memling might also have been inspired by a composition of that master. We find the same tile pattern in Van der Weyden's Annunciation in the Louvre, and in the Presentation in the Temple (Washington, National Gallery of Art) by a follower of Van der Weyden, now known as the Master of the Prado Adoration. By contrast, the arcade opening onto the landscape, which lends horizontal rhythm to the composition, is a pure Memling invention. An interesting detail in the landscape is the church on the right, which could be the abbey church of Seligenstadt, Memling's birthplace. The architectural significance of the second row of small columns of a different type, which stands behind the parapet and supports a beam, is less plain. The painting might originally have had wings that shed light on this feature.The doubt that is sometimes expressed as to Memling's own execution of this painting is entirely unwarranted. It is true that the dotted contours of the oval trees in the left background are inserted rather mechanically, and the perspective of the round column bases is rather forced, but none of this is sufficient reason to attribute such a refined and daintily executed painting to the workshop.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/memling/3mature2/21virgi.jpg,virgin and child

_art_w_weyden_rogier_17other_6medici.jpg,"This Sacra Conversazione may have been painted in 1450, the year in which Rogier visited Rome. Iconographical details indicate that it was probably commissioned by the Medici family (Saints Cosmas and Damian on the left were the Medici's patron saints, and a modified Florentine lily appears in the coat of arms). The painting is known as the Medici Madonna.The composition, in which the figures are grouped in a stepped, semicircular arrangement whose gentle curve is restated in the upper arch of the frame, may have been inspired by Domenico Veneziano's St Lucy altarpiece. A comparison of the two works nevertheless also reveals the fundamental differences between Flemish and Florentine painting around the middle of the 15th century. Rogier's figures stand close together; in comparison to Domenico's distinctly separate figures, Peter and John here appear directly connected. Their proportions are elongated (compare, for example, the two Johns) and they are given solidity more by the outlines of their robes than by the organic structure of their bodies.In the precision and texturing of his details, on the other hand, as seen in the plants and vase in the foreground, the glass bottle in St Cosmas' hand, and the sumptuous damask inside the tent-like baldachin, Rogier introduced his Florentine contemporaries to what must have been a whole new experience of painting.Italian clients valued the painting of the Netherlandish artist, so different from the ideals of Renaissance art, for its delicacy and for the artist's ability to capture the material nature of objects realistically in oils (particularly when painting shimmering light and reflections).

_art_s_sassetta_various_1nevi.jpg,"This altarpiece, known from its subject as the Madonna delle Nevi (the Madonna of the Snows) was originally commissioned for one of the oldest and most venerable altars in the Siena cathedral. It stood immediately left of the doorway known as the Porta del Perdono - the side entrance to the cathedral that provided most immediate access to both the baptistery and to the civic centre of the Palazzo Pubblico and the Campo.Sassetta received the commission in 1430 from Ludovica Bertini, the widow of Turino di Matteo, the man responsible for both the cathedral sacristy and the baptismal font. According to one local chronicler, Turino had died in 1423 and been buried in front of the Porta del Perdono. In the contract for the altarpiece, Ludovica makes it clear that she is commissioning the work both in memory of her husband and also in her own right as a pious Franciscan tertiary, so the coat-of-arms of her own family as well as that of her husband appear prominently displayed on the richly ornamented fabric covering the Virgin's throne. Her commitment to the Franciscan Order is clearly demonstrated by the inclusion of Saint Francis in the right foreground of the main panel of the altarpiece. The imagery chosen for the rest of the altarpiece, however, was entirely Sienese and civic in intention. It depicts the familiar subject of the enthroned Virgin with the Christ Child on her lap and surrounded by angels and saints. The altarpiece therefore echoes the imagery of two of Siena's most revered civic icons - the front face of Duccio's high altarpiece for the cathedral  and Simone Martini's mural in the council hall of the Palazzo Pubblico. That such an association was explicitly intended is shown by the inscription engraved on the Virgin's halo: 'If you trust me, Siena, you will be full of favour'.The imagery of the altarpiece was elaborated in order to honour two of the Virgin's titles - 'Queen of Heaven' and 'Our Lady of the Snows'. Two angels behind the throne hold a crown over the Virgin's head. The angel on the left of the throne, meanwhile, carries a dish filled with snow and the angel on the right makes a snowball. The seven narrative scenes of the predella describe in detail the legend of Our Lady of the Snows. They show how, in the reign of Pope Liberius (352-66), the Virgin caused snow to fall miraculously in the heat of August on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. Furthermore, the snow fell precisely in the pattern of the ground plan of a church. The Virgin then instructed a wealthy layman and his wife, and Pope Liberius, to build a church in her honour on this site - a church that became Santa Maria Maggiore, one of Rome's major basilicas.",https://www.wga.hu/art/s/sassetta/various/1nevi.jpg,virgin and child

_art_m_malouel_madchild.jpg,"The half length figure of the Virgin, with the Child supported by her right arm, is shown within the three-dimensional representation of a window-frame. It was due to the influence of Sienese painting that this Byzantine type of picture found its way to the North. In the Burgundian (and French) painting this is the very first half figure representation of the Madonna and as such has remained unique for many years. This small picture (which is only as big as a Book of Hours) may have stood on the altar of a domestic chapel or on a prie-dieu in the corner of a room.The motif of the window-frame provides the reason why the Virgin is represented as a half length figure. In this way the Madonna comes close to the praying person, but, at the same time, the frame emphasizes the majesty of the Mother of God. (Because rulers generally appeared at a window to show themselves to the people, the window became a symbol of royalty.) The painter may have had in mind the medieval hymns in which the Virgin was praised as ""the Window of Heaven"" (fenestra coeli), as it was through her that the Lord endowed the world with genuine light.The Child's delicate body is also depicted from the waist upwards, emerging from Mary's wide and velvety soft cloak. It is not the primary purpose of the drapery to convey the structure of the underlying figure, for the drapery forms an independent element of the composition, which can be modelled as the artist wishes. (See, for example, the protruding form at the Madonna's right shoulder.) The arrangement whereby the folds of the mantle spread out radially from the Madonna's left wrist is most refined and so is the narrowing down of the blue area of the whole drapery at the bottom part of the picture.The two figures are almost fused together by love, and yet are surrounded by a melancholy mood, the austere premonition of the Passion. The Virgin is absorbed in her thoughts, the Child opens His big, round eyes and looks at the spectator. His forefinger may enjoin silence upon the approaching worshipper. We can see the same motif in Stefano da Verona's Madonna in the Rosary, whose style as well as that of Michelino da Besozzo's The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine were directly influenced by the painting which originated from the Malouel workshop.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/malouel/madchild.jpg,virgin and child
_art_m_memling_1early1_01virgin.jpg,"Despite showing some signs of wear, this painting is something of a key work in our understanding of Memling's debut as a fully fledged master. Little studied until recently, it has long been viewed as one of Memling's earliest works, a youthful painting dating from before 1468 that might be a copy after Rogier van der Weyden. This is the most Rogierian Virgin ever done by Memling. The taut drawing and curved outlines within the compact triangle formed by the Virgin's head and hands and the Child do not appear in any other Memling work, except for copies after Van der Weyden, like the Brussels Virgin and Child. It is doubtful whether this too is a copy, however, as no other versions of the type exist. The overall composition is, in fact, a kind of adapted synthesis of the most famous Rogierian devices. The view between two columns, the crenellated wall and the perspective of the buildings on the left and right come from St Luke Painting the Virgin, the arch motif from the Miraflores altarpiece and the little dark blue angels from the Vienna Crucifixion. Memling's own vision is apparent even at this early stage in the calm, frontal position of the Virgin on her metal throne, accompanied symmetrically by musical angels. The golden sky is an interestingly archaic element that we rarely encounter even in Van der Weyden (Philadelphia Crucifixion, Frankfurt Medici Virgin).

_art_m_memling_6copies_0341virg.jpg,"Although this little work is abraded in places, its original delicate quality can still be observed in the sharp features, the thin shapes of the limbs and hand and the fine folds. However, it cannot be a Memling. Neither the facial type nor the weak, doll-like structure bears witness to his hand. It is one of those Virgin-and-Child compositions in the manner of the master which may be based on a Memling prototype. This prototype would then most likely be situated early in his career, around the time of the New York tondo or the Virgin of the Wernher Collection. Roughly of the same type, but full-length, is Memling's Granada Virgin. And the golden background with dark clouds is reminiscent of the wings with an Angel with an olive-branch and an Angel with a sword (Paris-London).The type is based on a composition by Rogier van der Weyden, which is itself only known from a workshop replica (Chicago, Art Institute) and from a copy in the style of Memling. Since Memling applied the type once again in the triptych with the Adoration of the Magi (Madrid, Museo del Prado), one can assume that Memling disposed of a cartoon or model of this composition.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/memling/6copies/0341virg.jpg,virgin and child

It was a pivotal work in an unusual and prolific copying enterprise. From the 1450s to the mid-1490s, the composition appeared in thirty-eight panel paintings executed by a workshop close to Pesellino and Filippo Lippi. These copies and variants were produced using a mechanical transfer method – stencil-like pounced cartoons, rubbed over with charcoal dust. A very similar painting in Esztergom, Hungary, is probably also an autograph work by Pesellino. The modeling is very delicate and the brushwork fluid.

Sluter transformed the portal composition by increasing the size of the statues and alternating standing and seated figures. The Virgin occupies the whole trumeau. She is no longer a jamb-figure, but instead a self-sufficient statue full of life and passionate movement. The baroque character of the movement, modelling, and drapery shatters the traditional conception of the Virgin.

The artist indicates her floating, vision-like quality with the use of fantastic lighting and an army of angels in concentric circles. By arranging the choir of angels in a manner reminiscent of spheres, it is also expressed that the infant Jesus in the centre of the picture is the ruler of the Universe. With a sweeping gesture and a look of concentration, the infant is shaking two bells, as if to be in concert with the angel doing the same thing on the left side of the picture. They are definitely looking at each other, and since they are the only two doing this, the action has special significance: it shows the ""conductor"" Jesus in the role of the universe's prime mover. Thus the painting clearly expresses a concept formulated by St Thomas Aquinas, according to which Jesus created the harmony of the spheres.In Geertgen's painting the three attributes of Mary (glory, sadness and joy) are represented by angels encircling the Madonna in three rings. The inner circle contains six-winged cherubs and seraphs. The angels of the second circle hold above the head of Mary the early Christian symbols of glorification, scrolls with the word ""Sanctus"" appearing on them three times. The rest bear the objects associated with the Passion: the cross, the crown of thorns, a spear, nails, a hammer, and a column. The outside circle presents a multitude of musical angels, symbolizing heavenly happiness. Here we can see nearly all of the instruments of the period: lutes, violas, double recorders, trumpets, drums, bells, horns, bagpipes, hurdy-gurdies, etc. The larger keyboard instruments are located in the corners; on the organ we can see the hand-operated bellows.

_art_b_botticel_22_50bardi.jpg,"Botticelli painted one of his most impressive altar paintings, the Virgin and Child Enthroned between St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, known as the Bardi altarpiece, for Giovanni de' Bardi. Bardi, who came from Florence, was known as the ""great English merchant"" by his contemporaries; he had directed the London branch of the Medici bank for a long period and had made his money exporting wool. When Bardi returned to his native city from England in 1483, he built a chapel in Santo Spirito for his spiritual salvation. The altar top and paneling is still in the Bardi Chapel today, in a prominent location to the left of the choir. The altarpiece, in contrast, is now in the Berlin Gemäldegalerie; the original frame, produced by the wood carver and architect Giuliano da Sangallo, has been lost.Portrayed as the so-called Madonna lactans, the Virgin is baring her breast in order to feed her child. The client, Giovanni de' Bardi, chose the two saints John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, his patron saints, as intercessors. The Baptist, being the patron saint of Florence, was accorded the place of honour to the right of the Mother of God, and he is pointing the observer towards the Madonna and child. At his feet lies the instrument of his work, the baptismal bowl. The Evangelist to the left of Mary is an old man; he is holding a quill and book, and the eagle behind him is his evangelist's symbol.The composition of this Sacra Conversazione clearly shows his originality. Botticelli produced a different solution to the classical three-part structure of such paintings, showing the enthroned Madonna and Child flanked by saints, from that of his artistic colleagues. He did not simply use architectural elements to structure the picture surface, but mainly used naturalistically painted niches of foliage to form a deferential backdrop for the holy figures.",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/botticel/22/50bardi.jpg,virgin and child

_art_c_cleve_joos_st_anne.jpg,"Antwerp experienced an extraordinary economic boom around 1500. The export of luxury goods grew so fast that many artists came to establish themselves there ""... because art loves the company of wealth"". The painter Joos van der Beke, also known as Joos van Cleve, was enrolled in 1511 as a master painter in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. Most of his fruitful career took place in Antwerp.The scene of St Anne with the Virgin and Child and St Joachim presents three generations: the grandparents, the mother and the infant Jesus. Although the present panel may well have come from a place of worship, this type of popular representation is mainly intended for private devotion. Van Cleve's command of space, colour and light is masterly. The balanced composition with the central figure of St Anne is placed in an equilateral triangle. In the centre, the most important element, lies the infant Jesus, comfortably asleep in his grandmother's lap. Although the divine family forms the centre, attention is immediately drawn to the two wide landscapes onto which the loggia opens: a small, moated castle, some houses, a dovecote. The interior displays considerable wealth: Anne sits enthroned in front of a 'mille-fleurs' tapestry, hung between two porphyry columns with bronze Corinthian capitals. The fabrics are also richly reproduced, with the women's red and blue gold-hemmed mantles standing out strongly against Joachim's fur-lined overcoat. The figure of Joachim is somewhat puzzling. Until now he was regarded by all authors as being Joseph. The rich dress and the clearly painted purse hardly fit with the poor carpenter, but with Anne's first husband, who was indeed a wealthy man. When he arrived at the temple in Jerusalem, the high priest refused his gold coins because he was childless. This makes the purse on the belt an allusion to the refused offering.The balanced composition and the collected expressions of the figures radiate an unprecedented serenity that points to Italian influence. More than many of his contemporaries, Van Cleve was open to all kinds of influence, not only of artists from his vicinity such as Quentin Massys, but also to Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht DÃ¼rer.",https://www.wga.hu/art/c/cleve/joos/st_anne.jpg,virgin and child

Though in his altarpieces he employed the traditional forms of the fourteenth century, the marked plasticity of his figures, and their vivacity, foreshadow the trends of the fifteenth century.The central panel of the triptych portrays the Madonna dell'Umilita, a type of representation popular in the fourteenth-century Siena. Mary, seated on a brocade carpet, is about to give the breast to her Child, while hovering angels hold a crown above her head. St John the Baptist and St Andrew are depicted in the wing panels, and in the lower part seven more saints can be seen. An inscription on the picture informs us that the altar was commissioned by Signora Datuccia to commemorate the dead members of her family.Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the triptych remained in its original place in a chapel of the church of San Francesco in Pisa.",https://www.wga.hu/art/t/taddeo/virgin.jpg,virgin and child

Such examples invariably showed youthful angels, however, rather than putti, which were far more common in North Italian painting of the period. Mantegna's San Zeno Altarpiece, or another example of its type which Gossart had seen during his Italian sojourn in 1508-09 may well have provided Gossart with a precedent for the close pose and placement of the putti at the base of the Virgin's throne.An unusual feature of the painting is that the Virgin's head was apparently left blank and has been repainted several times.

_art_n_niccolo_sozzo_virgin_c.jpg,"In the second half of the fourteenth century there are many instances of well-established Sienese master-painters collaborating on single commissions. It may be that the development was precipitated by the fact that there was not much work to go round and it had to be shared among different painters. But it seems more likely that the reverse was the case and that too much was being demanded of fewer specialist craftworkers. This large altarpiece signed on its lower edge by both Niccolò di Ser Sozzo and Luca di TommÃ¨ in 1362 provides a striking example of such collaboration. Now divested of its original piers, pinnacle panels and predella, the altarpiece was painted probably for the high altar of San Tommaso, a church under the care of the religious order known as the Humiliati. Accordingly, the apostle Thomas is portrayed on the Virgin's right-hand side, a position conventionally understood as that of greatest honour. To his right appears Saint John the Baptist, while Saints Benedict and Stephen appear to the left of the Virgin. The general consensus among art historians is that Niccolò di Ser Sozzo painted the Virgin and Christ Child, Saint Benedict and Saint Stephen while Luca di TommÃ¨ painted Saints John the Baptist and Thomas.",https://www.wga.hu/art/n/niccolo/sozzo/virgin_c.jpg,virgin and child

Her face and skin as well as the body of the Infant Jesus are a pale grey-white, as if painted in grisaille; the grey-blue of her robe makes for an impression of fatigue and languor. The throne, sumptuously adorned with marble panels, pearls, precious stones and great gold tassels, is surrounded by cherubs painted in vivid red and blue; their figures, recalling two-dimensional decorations, completely fill the rest of the panel. There is a tradition that AgnÃ©s Sorel, this famous beauty of the period, was the model for this Madonna, and the extraordinarily fashionable and somewhat frivolous appearance of the figure, unbefitting the Queen of Heaven, gives some ground for believing it not too far from the truth. In The Waning of the Middle Ages Huizinga described this painting as a most appalling example of a dangerous blend of amorous and religious feelings.

_art_w_weyden_rogier_17other_2duran.jpg,"There are works by Rogier van der Weyden's own hand artistically related to the Miraflores Altarpiece. In the impressive Madonna in Red - also known as the DurÃ¡n Madonna, after a former owner - there is an architectural niche very like the portals of the altarpiece, again with an angel hovering with a crown at the apex. At the same time, it picks up ideas from the great Deposition (Prado, Madrid): a ""living"" figure of the Virgin appears where a statue would normally stand, removed from any realistic or narrative environment. Any additional explanatory motifs - for instance the small painted sculptures present in other works - are absent from the DurÃ¡n Madonna, and the colours are restricted to only a few values. In her red robe, glowing with an unreal light, and framed in a sculptural niche, the Virgin appears withdrawn and majestic, though her loving attention to her son and the rough, childish way he is leafing through the book are very human touches in themselves. The painting may perhaps come chronologically between the Deposition and the Miraflores Altarpiece, for the angel holding the crown appears more meaningful in the Madonna panel, and is placed above Mary's head in line with pictorial tradition.",https://www.wga.hu/art/w/weyden/rogier/17other/2duran.jpg,virgin and child

Deep layers of solid and glazed lacquer are superimposed, often tone on tone and finely touched, from the clothes of the Virgin shaded in the grey filaments and earth green of the veil falling on her neck, to the profiles and extremely tender tips of the two children's fingers, heightened in white with the tip of the brush. Then there is the skillful painting of the Virgin's ear and of every other element in the work; the power of invention and of colour evident in the small patch of sky; the effect of shaping on form, seen in the facial features and breast of the Virgin, portrayed to great plastic effect, and partly the entire placement of the figures and overall composition, sensitive to the lessons of Caravaggio.",https://www.wga.hu/art/r/rubens/14religi/70religi.jpg,virgin and child

The Child's pose is the typological match of the Virgin Enthroned in Berlin, with both examples deriving from a prototype of Rogier van der Weyden. The angels hold musical instruments - a partially hidden lute on the left, and a fiddle on the right. Their albs and wings are painted in refined hues, in Memling's characteristic fashion: the angel on the left in white with grey wings, and the one on the right with a delicate lilac sheen and light purple wings, blending into yellow around the edges. The Virgin sits in a small, enclosed garden, as in the Munich diptych, before a hedge of white and red roses, with a white lily in their midst. The Marian symbolism of this is clear, as is the fact that the spot is sealed off from the remainder of the landscape by a reinforced wall to the rear.

_art_m_massys_quentin_3_virgin2.jpg,"The Virgin is seated in three-quarter profile on an imposing stone throne with Gothic ornamentation. Richly dressed in a dark red, fur-lined gown and a mantle bordered with pearl braiding, her head inclined in recollection, she holds the infant Jesus on her right arm. She appears to be meditating a passage in the book that Christ is thumbing. Their faces are surrounded by halos of golden rays. The Child, in a long white shirt, has seized the bookmark. Through an open window to the right of the throne we glimpse a building on the other side of a courtyard. The upper part of the window is decorated with a stained glass panel depicting St Catherine flanked by two escutcheons. A similar stained glass window to the left carries the figure of St Barbara.This painting, attributed to Quentin Massys, is part of the Madonna with Child group that the artist painted during his youth. The symmetrical composition, the hieratic presentation of the figures, the style of the Virgin's garments and the vigorous modelling of the draperies as well as the Gothic ornamentations all recall the tradition of the Flemish Primitives. The iconographic theme picks up the traditional image of Christ's incarnation. The Virgin in majesty is directly associated with the divine nature of her Son, the Word incarnate. Her meditative attitude and the red of her garments evoke the presentiment she had of her Child's destiny right from his birth.Massys' work refers back to earlier compositions that present Christ reading in the Virgin's arms. Two famous examples are Rogier van der Weyden's Madonna DurÃ¡n (Madrid, Prado) and the Ince Hall Virgin attributed to a follower of Jan van Eyck (Melbourne, National Gallery of Victoria). With Massys we have the same monumental pose of the Virgin, with the niche-shaped throne similar to the one in Van der Weyden's painting. Even if the Brussels Madonna with Child shows how much the painter was part of the Flemish tradition, before coming under the influence of the Renaissance, it already contains the novel elements that were to make Massys the captivating and highly innovative artist whose talent would be fully revealed in his later works. With his exceptionally ample volumes, his supple shapes caressed by a strong, yet soft light, and the virtuoso translucency of his colouring technique, he carries the art of modelling forward to new heights.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/massys/quentin/3/virgin2.jpg,virgin and child

At the beginning of the last century this half-length Madonna in Budapest was so attributed and it certainly shows an unmistakably close link with Leonardo, the surviving series of whose drawings demonstrate that he was occupied with the idea of a composition in which the infant Jesus stretches his arms towards flowers in a vase. Nor is it only in the type of picture that the Budapest Madonna is related to  Leonardo. The subtlety of the detail, for instance the beauty of Mary's hands, the tender pose of the heads and the accomplished execution of the rich drapery, all provide evidence that the link with Leonardo is more than a matter of inspiration or borrowing of motifs.

_art_m_master_holybloo_altar1.jpg,"The Master of the Holy Blood was a Bruges follower of Quentin Massys and he takes his name from a triptych in the Holy Blood Museum in Bruges, which formed the nucleus around which his oeuvre has been reconstructed. This triptych in the Groeninge Museum - displayed in the original frame - is one of his best surviving altarpieces.The main scene represents a Rest on the Flight into Egypt in which the seated Virgin with the Child on her lap is accompanied by St Catherine, who as Christ's bride receives the symbolic ring, and St Barbara who holds a peacock's feather in her hand. It is a rather exceptional combination of the biblical theme with that of the Virgo inter Virgines. There is an echo of Memling in both the general layout as a triptych and the composition of the main scene, which is remotely reminiscent of the St John altarpiece (Memlingmuseum, Bruges).In the middle ground of the rocky landscape three angels are picking figs (a `poetic' variant of the palm-tree miracle) and on the right walks Joseph, perhaps taking the figs to Mary, who indeed holds a fig in her left hand. The donors on the wings, protected respectively by St Joachim and St Judocus, were identified as Joachim Christiaens, orator of the deanery in Bruges (regularly mentioned between 1535 and 1552) and city councillor (in 1530, 1534, 1536 and 1544), and his second wife Jossine Lamsins. In the background of the three panels small scenes are depicted from the legend of the saints in the foreground. On the left wing at the level of the founder's head is the Preaching of St John the Baptist, a scene connected with the patron saint of the former donor. Above this on the hill is the Annunciation to Joachim, which was added later. Behind St Catherine, on the far left next to the rocks, is her martyrdom with the wheel and the heavenly lightning. Behind St Barbara in front of the rocks is the shepherd with his flock who will betray Barbara's hideaway in the rocks to her father. He is shown talking to Barbara's father, while in the scene above Barbara is being threatened by her father in the cave. The pilgrim begging for alms in the right wing at the back is connected with the story of St Judocus.The exterior features an Annunciation in grisaille on a red marbled background.The triptych, which dates from around 1520-25, is the first work by this anonymous master to be found in which donor figures appear, and since it is clearly of Bruges origin, there can be no more doubt about his being active in Bruges.Joachim Christiaens died in 1552 and Jossine Lamsins in 1557.

It may be that the development was precipitated by the fact that there was not much work to go round and it had to be shared among different painters. But it seems more likely that the reverse was the case and that too much was being demanded of fewer specialist craftworkers. This large altarpiece signed on its lower edge by both Niccolò di Ser Sozzo and Luca di TommÃ¨ in 1362 provides a striking example of such collaboration. Now divested of its original piers, pinnacle panels and predella, the altarpiece was painted probably for the high altar of San Tommaso, a church under the care of the religious order known as the Humiliati. Accordingly, the apostle Thomas is portrayed on the Virgin's right-hand side, a position conventionally understood as that of greatest honour. To his right appears Saint John the Baptist, while Saints Benedict and Stephen appear to the left of the Virgin.

Its perspective lines converge at a vertical axis marked by the figure of the Virgin, on both sides of whom the remaining elements in the composition are symmetrically arranged. Gold leaf is used exclusively in the haloes and in the two small figures in the upper part of the throne; a cloudscape replaces the golden background typical of Gothic paintings, while the rear wall and the Virgin's mantle are decorated with painted gold and silver brocades, all of which point to the Renaissance.Other features, such as the wings of the angels and particularly the angular folds of the fabrics, refer to Flemish painting. The figures of the donors in the lower area, depicted on a smaller scale, are an archaism. In addition to the eclecticism of this work, mention should be made of its balanced composition, the serene attitude of the characters portrayed and its fine technical finish.

The genesis of the new plastic style occurred within the Late Gothic tradition, taking the old methods a step further while developing new rhetoric in perfect osmosis with the contemporary graphic and pictorial language, as shown by the sculptures of Hans Leinberger. If, for example, the tumultuous draperies clothing his figures and soaring far out from the body in arbitrary folds spring from the previous Gothic conception, their treatment avoid angles and breaks in favour of floating undulations at the edges and large inflated folds, tracing long diagonals interrupted here and there by little stiff crinkles on the surface of the fabric: a treatment closely corresponding to the manner of Albrecht Altdorfer.

_art_g_guido_madonna.jpg,"On top of the painting Christ Blessing and Two Angels are represented.In thirteenth-century Siena several lay organizations existed whose members regularly attended masses, participated in religious processions, prayed together and sang hymns or ""laude"". One kind of confraternities, the ""Laudesi"" took their name from their custom of singing laude. These were frequently written in honour of the Virgin and Laudesi companies therefore often used a painted image of the Virgin and Christ Child as a focal point of their collective act of singing. The most imposing examples of thirteenth-century Sienese paintings that survive today have been associated with them, including Guido da Siena's panel painting of the Virgin and Christ Child Enthroned, which is the only certain work of the artist.The picture bears the date 1221. but this has been the subject of much controversy as stylistically the painting seems to belong about half a century later. It has been suggested that the inscription may have some commemorative purpose, the significance of which is now lost, rather than being a record of the date of execution.Although the painting is majestic in effect and follows Byzantine conventions of iconography, the figures are more natural in posture, to some extent relaxing the stiff linear patterns which had been conventional in central Italian painting up to that time. The throne too is set in a deeper picture space, which adds to the realism of the figures.On the basis of this picture a number of other panels, most of which are in the Siena Pinacoteca, have been assigned to Guido or his school.

The throne in St Osyth is not, however, white but amber coloured and is profusely decorated with tracery, foliage and trails, and little sculptures in white stone. The sculpture that tops the throne represents the archangel expelling Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. The link with the Incarnation as the work's principal theme is clear. Recent cleaning showed the painting to be less damaged than had initially been feared, and uncovered the uppermost part of the house that can be made out hazily through the stained glass of the right window.

_art_m_master_xunk_it_xunk_it0_04virgi.jpg,"The painting is split into five sections. The central part shows the Virgin and Child Enthroned. There are two scenes to their left and right - The Birth of the Virgin, Annunciation, Nativity and Assumption. The vertical division, in which the central part is separated from the sides by two painted columns, is a precursor of the triptych altarpieces and enables us to identify the painting as Tuscan or Umbrian. In 1949 from a faint inscription found beneath Mary's feet the painting was identified as the work of Simeone and Machilone of Spoleto. These Umbro-Sienese masters worked in Ancona, Florence, Pisa, Siena and Orvieto, absorbing the influence of all those centres.The painting has a Byzantine feel and is strongly influenced by the Sienese and Florentine schools. The architectural structure in the scenes showing the Birth of the Virgin and the Annunciation is Sienese. Whereas Marian cycles in the Byzantine tradition generally culminated in the assumption of Mary's soul, this painting focuses on the bearing of her body to heaven. This is a Western theme which only became truly popular in Italy in the 14th century, establishing itself first in Sienese art. The Annunciation scene, in which Mary turns from the angel in fright, also betrays a Sienese influence. By contrast, the throne on which she sits, the drapery of her robe and her facial type are all specifically Florentine. The Birth of the Virgin and the Nativity have the same composition. The drowsing Joseph in the latter scene is interesting, as are the two midwives bathing the infant.

His compositions, however, remained traditional, and in many of his paintings we find only slight variations of the arrangement seen in this picture.In this altarpiece the assembly of saints and angels surrounding the Virgin are placed under a pergola - hence the name given to the work.

Confectionery made of crystallized sugar, nuts, figs and raisins, some in a costly Chinese bowl and some outside it, represent spiritual principles which are being guarded, as it were, by the green-feathered parrot sitting on the far edge of the bowl. The religious context is further emphasized by the grapes and the wine glass, and indeed by the carnation. From the late Middle Ages onwards theologians saw carnations as a symbol of Christ's death on the cross, because of the nail-shaped form of petals and fruit. Furthermore, the coins at the front are probably another reference to the Passion, reminding us of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.",https://www.wga.hu/art/f/flegel/dessert.jpg,still-life

_art_b_bray_joseph_praise_h.jpg,"Fish still-lifes developed as a category during the seventeenth century - not an astonishing phenomenon when we recall that fishing, particularly for herring and cod, was a mainstay of the Dutch economy. A notable exponent of the type is Abraham van Beyeren. As the Dutch love for flowers, their love for seafood is proverbial. The Haarlemer Joseph de Bray, son of Salomon and brother of Jan, celebrated this taste in his picture, dated 1656, dedicated to the apotheosis of the pickled herring.Resting behind the large, succulent herring and other objects in the painting's foreground, there is an elaborate tablet, draped with a festoon of herrings and requisite onions, inscribed with a poem by the Remonstrant preacher and poet Jacob Westerbaen: 'In praise of the Pickled Herring' published in 1633. After telling of the herring's delight to the eye, palette, and its other qualities, Westerbaen adds that consumption of it 'Will make you apt to piss/And you will not fail/(With pardon) to shit/And ceaselessly fart...' - proof, if it is needed, that plain profane messages are as likely embodied in Dutch paintings as spiritual ones. The painting was evidently a success. In the following year he painted another, somewhat larger still-life, now in Aachen, dedicated to the same subject. It includes the text of Westerbaen's verse dedicated to the pickled herring, and a brief passage from his poem 'Cupido' on the page of an open folio accompanied by an ample display of herrings and onions.",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bray/joseph/praise_h.jpg,still-life

He spent his youth in Leiden and as demonstrated by this work, he established close connection with the Leiden school of painting.This splendid painting invokes the memory of the golden age of Dutch still-life painting. The sumptuousness of the instruments is especially fascinating. Most prominent among them is the six-stringed, inlaid viola da gamba leaning against the chair, with a lion's head for decoration and an ""S"" shaped sound hole (more characteristic of violin). Next to it on the ground are two types of lutes, a trumpet, a flute and a mandolin; in a chair on the left, a violin, a bagpipe and a small pocket violin.On the table, richly laid with fruits and golden objects, are the traditional symbols of Vanitas. To illustrate the transitoriness of pleasures gained from wealth, plentitude and eating and drinking, there is an up-ended wine jug from which its content have spilled onto the ground, symbolizing that earthly pleasure is short-lived and man will return to dust. In this context the instruments are symbols of physical love. Next to them the painter depicted a snail on the ground. It was generally believed that this animal was born of mud, thus it became the symbol of sin. In contrast, the ivy crawling up the wall in the background promises immortality. The peach, melon and fig, since they are cut open and their seeds are revealed, symbolize reviviscence and resurrection. This image make the message of the painting less somber, although its warning intent is unmistakably recognizable.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 12 minutes):Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in G major for two mandolins and orchestra, RV 532 -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/h/heem/cornelis/vanitas.jpg,still-life

The sole document relating to Salini is his last will and testament of 12 September 1625 and the posthumous inventory of his property drawn up between 14 and 16 September. The summary descriptions in the inventory were endorsed by the flower painter par excellence, Mario Nuzzi, called Mario de' Fiori, who was the pupil and nephew of Salini as well as his heir. The lists drawn up in his presence make no mention of paintings similar to this still-life. With these invaluable documents to hand, the name 'Salini' must be looked at in a new light.

The present example bears traces of the inventory mark that identifies the earlier group, and is remarkable for the period because of the casual arrangement of the sheep's head with its expressive eye, and sides of mutton. The signature is painted in red as if to simulate blood. For stylistic reasons this and other still lifes of the group - pictures of meat, fish, fowl and game - cannot be much earlier than the date they are recorded in Goya's house. This means that they must have been painted about the time of the 'ano del hambre', the year of the terrible famine in Madrid in 1811-12, when thousands died of hunger, thus raising the question of whether any allusion to the famine was intended by Goya. Were they perhaps meant as a sardonic commentary on the situation in one of the many illustrations of the effects of famine in his Desastres de la Guerra?

_art_a_aelst_deadbird.jpg,"In addition to fruit and flower still-lifes with cool colour harmonies, van Aelst also enjoyed painting elegant hunting weapons and dead animals placed in a dark corner by a wall for rich clients. One example is this still-life.A dead partridge is hanging by its leg from a piece of string. Its wings and feathers, which are grey with brownish patches, open up towards us at the bottom like a fan. The fly on the light-coloured feathers has an illusionist effect: disproportionately large in size, it belongs to the realistic level of the picture rather than its fictitious one, so that the viewer is given the impression that a real fly is crawling across the painting. The bird's head has been pressed slightly towards the middle by the blue hunting bag with the golden fringe and the adjustable shoulder strap which is lying on the stone shelf. Beside the partridge a hunting horn, also adorned with tassels, and a powder bottle have been hung up. The shiny, metallic grey of the hunting horn has been painted by the artist with a highly sensitive eye for the different hues of the bird's fluffy, grey feathers on its breast and as a contrast to the grey of the wings which merges into white towards the middle.But, although the bird has been rendered with almost unsurpassable precision, it has an odd abstract quality. It seems as if, in its material consistency, it had undergone a synthesis with the implement of civilization by which it was pursued - as if it was no longer merely part of nature and a victim, but an aesthetically refined and ennobled form of existence.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in B flat major RV 362 op. 8 No. 10 (Hunt) -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/a/aelst/deadbird.jpg,still-life

For the young painter, the Dutch influence proved decisive on several account: it can be detected in his still-lifes with flowers and fruits in the use of colours, while the genre-like composition of his paintings depicting birds reveals the assimilation of Melchior de Hondecoeter's paintings of animals. Elegant parks with beautiful birds are the sites of BogdÃ¡ny's high society genre scenes. The exquisite components, such as fountains or antique ruins, enhance the grace and refinement of the composition.

_art_k_kalf_stilhorn.jpg,"Exceptionally for a still-life specialist, the Rotterdam-born Kalf was praised by an Amsterdam poet as one of the city's leading painters. Perhaps the praise would not have been forthcoming had he persevered in his first interest: shabby peasant barn interiors and still-lifes of humble kitchen implements, painted during his stay in Paris from about 1640 to 1646. After his arrival in Amsterdam, however, following his marriage to a cultivated young woman of good family, Kalf began to paint the type of still-life for which he is best known.Called in Dutch pronkstilleven ('still-lifes of display or ostentation'), these compositions, influenced by Flemish antecedents, feature luxury manufactured goods - silverware, Chinese porcelain, Oriental carpets, fragile glass - and exotic foodstuffs. They do not seem to have specific symbolic meaning but must have spoken to contemporary viewers of the wealth of the Dutch Republic, the might of its sea power and the efficiency of its distribution systems - for all this is implied in the eastern table carpet and in the fresh Italian lemon unwinding its peel in the foreground.The buffalo-horn in a silver mount belonged to the Saint Sebastian Archers' Guild, part of the city's civic guard. Dated 1565, this beautiful example of the silversmith's art, now in the Historisch Museum in Amsterdam, also testifies to the old Netherlandish tradition of municipal freedom, and the will of Dutch burghers to defend it. Kalf was to paint it more than once; it also appears in pictures by other artists.Ultimately, however, none of these associations is responsible for the grave monumental beauty of Kalf's painting. As in all his mature works, only a few objects are displayed and soberly arranged, in contrast with the luxuriant profusion of Flemish still-lifes. Against a dark background, succulent paint, broadly applied, models large forms and captures the very feel of surface textures. Strong accents of the richest and brightest colours surge to the surface - the huge scarlet lobster, the clear yellow and white lemon, touched with pink where it reflects the lobster. And it is the play of reflections and tinted shadows of these powerful hues which, like a musical motif, draws the composition together.",https://www.wga.hu/art/k/kalf/stilhorn.jpg,still-life

_art_g_gogh_van_08_1arles12.jpg,"Catalogue numbers: F 410, JH 1426.In his Dutch years van Gogh had employed a tonal palette typical of the Barbizon painters and some of the Hague School artists. But in 1884-85 he encountered a new theory of colour in the books and articles he was reading about the French painter Delacroix. From these texts van Gogh derived the thesis that one of the distinguishing features and great discoveries of recent art that made it 'modern' was the use of complementary and contrasting colours in place of tonality and chiaroscuro. The basic message of his reading was that each primary colour - red, blue, yellow - has a complementary colour composed of a mixture of the other two. The complement of red is green; of blue, orange; of yellow, violet. Shadows cast by an object should include the complementary colour of the object. Complementaries are also used to heighten and intensify the brilliance of colour. In his ambition to be modern van Gogh adopted these theories, but without a sophisticated understanding of them or a sound technical foundation as a painter. He applied them crudely and programmatically, though often with unexpectedly powerful and original effects.During the spring and summer of 1888 van Gogh corresponded regularly with Ãmile Bernard, giving his friend reports on work in progress and describing his colour experiments such as this still-life. The complementary pairs of blue and orange, yellow and violet can be easily recognized in this painting, and from the colour notes added to a sketch of it included in a letter to Bernard it is clear that the red-green pair was also employed.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/gogh_van/08/1arles12.jpg,still-life

He stayed a second time at Pont-Aven, where a new and decisive meeting with Ãmile Bernard brought forward a new doctrine about painting. He broke away from Impressionism and applied the cloisonnism which he developed together with Bernard. The attempt at a contrived 'primitive' quality which Gauguin developed in Brittany, is particularly marked in this painting. The cloisonne effect of The Vision of the Sermon is developed, so that objects are outlined and strangely isolated against the backdrop of the tablecloth. The influence of Japanese art is particularly evident, and the composition may have been based on a print by Kuniyoshi. Added to the high viewpoint, and with the suppression of any tonal modelling, the two-dimensional surface of the picture space is exploited. In addition, the self-conscious naivety of the subject is enhanced by the grouping of objects into threes.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/gauguin/02/3ponta03.jpg,still-life

_art_b_boel_vanitas.jpg,"The painting shows a sarcophagus in a half-ruined church, with its vanishing point on the left. Objects of vanity are assembled in the foreground, piled up in the shape of a pyramid and culminating in an ermine coat, a turban (at the very top, at the banister, next to the skull), a royal crown, a mitre and a globe. These symbols of secular and ecclesiastical power at the zenith of the composition are further explained by a richly decorated bowl, worked by a goldsmith. It shows mythological scenes of unhappy love relationships, partly covering those 'vanitates' which are of lower order - a tambourine, lute, sabre, coat of mail and painter's palette, to name but a few. The statue of a mourning female figure in one of the niches bears great resemblance to the woman whose contours can be seen in Nicolas Poussin's famous self-portrait  at the Louvre. She can be regarded as a late successor to the weeping women who surround the altar tomb of Philip the Bold in Dijon.Pieter Boel's painting contains all the features normally associated with baroque solemnity, i.e. pomp and splendour even where power and wealth have become subject to the darkness of death. However, although all earthly possessions and authority are marked as vain, the dialectic of the painting never leaves any doubt that their real substance remains undisputed in this world and that the earthly order is preserved intact.",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/boel/vanitas.jpg,still-life

He also painted many still-lifes, which, however, reflect the same qualities of asceticism, quiet contemplation and introversion for his choice of objects indicates the transience of human life.ZurbarÃ¡n does not do so by presenting a clock, a skull or an hourglass. Instead, on a brilliantly polished table, he shows us a pewter plate with lemons, a basket of oranges complete with leaves and blossoms, and a fine china cup on a silver saucer on which lies a rose in full bloom. Though lemons signify wealth in a Netherlandish still life, they have a very different meaning here, in the country where they actually grow. Even so, they are not represented as the fruits of daily life, but presented with all the solemn celebration of an offering on an altar.As in the paintings of his contemporary SÃ¡nchez CotÃ¡n, ZurbarÃ¡n isolates the individual objects from one another - even the composition appears to be a conscious though not excessively artificial arrangement.

The Neapolitan artists focused on decorative effect expressed through pictorial composition. This intention is reflected in a virtuoso style of painting that seeks to be recognised and esteemed as such.In this painting Malinconico evokes the sensual delights exclusively through the application of paint and the use of colour. Materials and their imitation in paint did not really interest Neapolitan artists at the end of the seventeenth century. Colour as matter became the prime concern.

_art_g_gogh_van_09_arles64.jpg,"Catalogue numbers: F 604, JH 1656.This cheerful still-life was painted shortly after van Gogh left the hospital in Arles which he had entered after his first major attack of psychomotor epilepsy on 25 December 1888. The objects depicted have both an allegorical and a more personal significance. The lighted candle, used in the painting of Gauguin's chair, derives from the emblematic tradition of still-life and signifies light and life; its opposite, the snuffed-out candle, was used in memento mori still-life and van Gogh had included it in a still-life with books which he painted after his father's death in 1885 (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh). The optimistic note sounded by the candle flame is underlined by the presence of the sprouting onions, taken from his Yellow Chair (a 'self-portrait'). On the other hand, van Gogh has added his pipe and tobacco and an empty bottle, possibly once containing absinthe, all of which endangered his health.Modern research has intriguingly shown that absinthe itself can cause epileptic fits. Van Gogh had consumed this poisonous beverage in some quantity during the months in Arles, and many of his subsequent fits coincide with occasions on which he had access to it. The drawing board on which most of these objects are placed indicates van Gogh's resumption of work. He informed his brother that he was painting still-lifes to ease himself back into painting after his hospitalization. However, the colours used in this painting are more tempered and less intense, more controlled and less arbitrary than those he had been using both in the summer of 1888 and under the aegis of Gauguin in the autumn preceding his attack.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/gogh_van/09/arles64.jpg,still-life

At times this pattern was of course broken, especially when Heda had to depict the valuable crockery of distinguished households, such as columbine goblets, cups of welcome, etc. Heda then went back either to his triangular or his pyramid-shaped compositions. But it is noticeable that whenever he did this, he also increased the incidence of 'chaotic' elements, showing, for example, the white table-cloth extremely crumpled as well as an overturned jug. (The overturning of goblets goes back to an ancient custom, and in the 16th and 17th centuries goldsmiths, for example, fashioned special goblets that had to be emptied all at once so that they could be placed on the table upside down.)",https://www.wga.hu/art/h/heda/stillif1.jpg,still-life

_art_m_melendez_stillife.jpg,"Judged the most talented student in the Spanish Royal Academy in 1745, MelÃ©ndez was expelled in 1748 as a result of a public dispute between the Academy and his father, also a painter. The expulsion prevented the artist from receiving commissions for altarpieces or large narrative pictures. In the last twenty years of his life he executed a hundred or so still lifes, for which he has now become famous. Although nearly half were first recorded in the Spanish royal residence at Aranjuez, they may not have been commissioned by the king directly from the painter, who died in poverty.This picture is one of a group of the artist's largest and finest works, perhaps made in connection with his second petition to the king to become court painter. Like most of MelÃ©ndez's still lifes, it focuses attention simultaneously on the geometrical forms of the homely and characteristically Spanish objects depicted - oranges, walnuts, a melon, wooden sweet boxes and barrel, terracotta jugs - and on their surface texture, and both shape and texture are revealed through the strong light falling from the upper left of the painting. The colours are restricted to black, white and a range of earth tones, relieved only by the brilliant orange. The spectator's viewpoint, so close to the picture surface, is located just above the smaller of the two jugs. Only the cracked walnuts allow us a glimpse of their edible flesh, among the unpeeled fruit and the sealed containers of sweetmeats, olives and oil, tantalisingly displayed humble products of Spanish soil and industry, ennobled by the artist's brush.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/melendez/stillife.jpg,still-life

He devotes himself to natural produce and man-made items with equal enthusiasm, piling them one behind or on top of the other and thereby filling the pictorial space. Plates, a white cloth, bread and a knife rise above the top of the woven basket into which they have been packed. The objects are painted in close-up and brought right to the front edge of the table, so that the melon curves forward into the space occupied by the viewer. The different surfaces are perfectly imitated and the painting of the melon skin, with its strikingly reticular texture, is astounding.

_art_m_mignon_still_1.jpg,"Like van Schrieck and Ruysch, Abraham Mignon also composed dioramic situations in the form of forest still-lifes. Set against a dark background without clear spatial delimitations, we can see pedestals and stone plinths building up from the ground. These are covered with an abundance of fruit and vegetables, with delicate stalks of grain winding themselves around pumpkins and corn cobs with blue and yellow kernels. Together with peaches, plums and grapes they combine to form an arrangement which has an affinity to de Heem's religious fruit still-lifes.This painting, too, includes an encoded Christian message. Because of its many seeds and its rapid growth, the pumpkin had been interpreted as a symbol of growing Christian faith since the early Middle Ages. Similar ideas were probably associated - as far as can be determined - with corn cobs and its many kernels, though corn is not mentioned in the Bible. Grapes and corns are well-known references to the Eucharist again. In Mignon's painting the artist arranged the fruit in such a way that it is framed vertically by branches growing upwards from the ground. These branches, which are probably intended to indicate an oak tree, are completely covered with moss and seem almost dried up, though some shoots can be identified which indicate the tree's ability to survive.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/mignon/still_1.jpg,still-life

_art_m_marseus_insects.jpg,"Among the Dutch still-life painters Otto Marseus van Schrieck has a special position. His somewhat exotic oeuvre has only come to be appreciated in more recent decades. He nearly always presents a small section of the woods with thick dark undergrowth, and a hidden microcosm in which frogs, toads, snakes and lizards crowd together, fighting for their lives. Marseus van Schrieck knew the habits of these animals very well and is known to have bred reptiles and snakes himself. This painting also shows bizarre botanical species, such as a coral fungus on the left and thistles, under which a lizard - a so-called lacerta - is hiding, about to attack the toad.Marseus van Schrieck has designed an idealized habitat, modelled on biological dioramas, which are illustrations with a three-dimensional effect. However, although the world of his paintings reflects the zoological and botanical interests of a well-versed science amateur, it is still not free from religious associations. Indeed, it is the religious meaning which determines the selection and composition of the animals and plants. The snake, the toad and the lizard are the 'unclean animals', the serpent had negative connotations and was regarded as an incarnation of evil, and such, was a favourite subject for depicting evil.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/marseus/insects.jpg,still-life

_art_m_melendez_stimelon.jpg,"Luis Egidio MelÃ©ndez is the most important Spanish still-life painter of the 18th century. He saw his bodegones as part of an ambitious project. In a petition addressed to King Charles III in 1772, he wrote that he was planning a series of paintings for a cabinet that would illustrate all the different foodstuffs produced by the Spanish climate over the four seasons in the four elements. Up to this point he had only finished those showing the fruits of the earth. He had the means neither to continue the project, however, nor indeed to feed himself.It seems somewhat unlikely that MelÃ©ndez planned his still-lifes as a coherent programme right from the outset; rather, he must have arrived at this idea as time went by and he found himself in possession of a sizeable stock of unsold pictures of food and household utensils. During these years he supplied 44 still-lifes to Prince Carlos of Asturia, the later King Charles IV. The paintings went first to the newly built Casita del PrÃ­ncipe, a country villa near the Escorial de Abajo.

_art_r_ruysch_s_plums.jpg,"Unlike that of most 17th and 18th century female artists, Rachel Ruysch's work has never sunk into obscurity. She also enjoyed public recognition of her talent during her lifetime: in 1701, three years before painting this particularly charming bouquet, she was the first woman to be admitted to the Confrerie Pictura in The Hague, and in 1708 Johann Wilhelm, the Elector of the Palatinate, appointed her to the position of court painter. The artist's specialities were compositions with fruit, flowers and woodlands. Within this genre she was never a real innovator, but she perfectly assimilated the work of others, equalling them in terms of her painting technique. At least for certain partial aspects of flower painting she sought her own solutions, thereby imposing her own stamp on her creations. During the final decade of the 17th century we can observe the influence in particular of her teacher, Willem van Aelst, and that of Simon Pietersz. Verelst. From the beginning of the 18th century she was inspired by Jan Davidsz. de Heem and Abraham Mignon.The use of a dark background for a bouquet is a tried and tested way of bringing colours and shapes to their own. The fact that very few flowers in the bouquet cross also shows that the painter wished to present the various species in a way that made them clearly recognisable. This almost scientific trait is certainly due, in Ruysch's case, to her father's position as a professor of botany. Typical for this period is the adding of insects and fruit of every kind, here a branch of plums. This fruit with its characteristic matt, bluish tint, which is so difficult to reproduce, appears to have been chosen by painters precisely in order to demonstrate their technical skill. One striking feature of this sumptuous bouquet is the S-shapes in the composition, with which Ruysch seeks a more natural-looking structure in contrast to the strong diagonals found in her earlier work. Rachel Ruysch's personality also speaks to our imagination: although building a professional career was something unusual for a woman at that time, she was simultaneously a ""normal"" woman of her time, as she bore ten children.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431 -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/r/ruysch/s_plums.jpg,still-life
_art_h_heyden_rarities.jpg,"Jan van der Heyden was one of the leading architectural painters of his generation and a man of more parts than most Dutch painters. When he was a boy of thirteen his parents settled in Amsterdam; apart from trips to the Rhineland, the northern, and the southern Netherlands he spent his life there. He painted some imaginary cityscapes based on studies done in Germany, which at first blush appear to be true-to-life views, and lovely capriccios which show expert knowledge of the principles of classical architecture. His oeuvre also includes about forty landscapes that reveal a debt to Adriaen van de Velde, who is credited with painting figures in some of his pictures, and a few intriguing still-lifes that can be justifiably categorized as interiors. Van der Heyden is best known for his views of Amsterdam.Most of van der Heyden's paintings were done in the sixties and seventies - his work as inventor, entrepreneur, and city official probably slacked his pace. But he continued to paint until the very end. His latest firmly datable picture, Still-life with Rarities, now in Budapest, shows the corner of a 'Kunstkamer' in strong even light with meticulous depictions of rarities from the natural and man-made world, but not the collector who assembled them. It is proudly inscribed with his monogram and states he painted it when he was seventy-five years old; he attained that age in 1712, the year he died.Among the objects displayed in the Kunstkamer, which is most probably a fictive one, are a hanging armour of an armadillo, a copy after an etching of Pietro Testa's Suicide of Dido above the marble mantle, an inlaid cabinet used for housing treasured coins and natural specimens, oriental weapons, and on the bright red Chinese embroidered cloth that covers the table globes, one terrestrial and the other celestial, and an open Blaeu atlas. Next to the table there is a red damask covered chair that supports a folio Bible open at the favourite passage of Dutch moralists: Ecclesiastes, Chapter I, which begins with 'The words of the Preacher . . . vanity of vanities; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?' The biblical reference to transience is reinforced by Testa's Suicide of Dido, a subject taken from Virgil's Aeneid which can be read as an exemplum of love's ephemeral nature.Van der Heyden's message is obvious and familiar. It is one we have heard from other still-life specialists: preparation for salvation is of greater importance than all the treasures, pleasures, and knowledge that can be derived from this world.",https://www.wga.hu/art/h/heyden/rarities.jpg,still-life

In Saint-RÃ©my he painted pink roses against a green ground, and here, violet irises against a yellow field. The painting betrays a renewed liveliness and intensity of colour. Instead of toning down the contrasts in order to harmonize the different parts of the painting, as he sometimes did, van Gogh has tried here, as he had done in Paris, to sharpen and heighten them. Van Gogh has painted these flowers on what was his preferred size of canvas in late 1888-90.

The genre flourished from the 1620s onward.The dominant motifs in the picture are a human skull and, floating above it, a transparent sphere or bubble. These forms occupy a stone niche with a slightly pointed arch, the keystone of which is inscribed HVMANA VANA (Human Vanity). The spandrels flanking the arch are filled with sculptural figures of philosophers with books at their feet? to the left, Democritus, who gestures toward the globe and laughs; and, to the right, Heraclitus, who points to the sphere and weeps. The sphere purposefully resembles a soap bubble, the familiar vanitas motif. Two common vanitas symbols, cut flowers and smoke, rise from urns at either side of the niche. The coins depicted at the bottom of the composition on the sill between the vases were used as currency in the Netherlands about 1600. One of them, the silver medal of 1602 commemorates the capture of a Portuguese galleon by two Zeeland merchant ships earlier that year, off Saint Helena in the South Atlantic.Democritus (c. 460 - c. 370 B.C.) and Heraclitus (c. 540 - c. 475 B.C.) are known as the 'laughing and crying philosophers.'Democritus, a Greek philosopher, born at Abdera in Thrace, was known as the laughing philosopher because he found amusement in the folly of mankind. (The citizens of Abdera were proverbially stupid.) His philosophic system was contrasted with that of the earlier Heraclitus of Ephesus, who was known as the 'Dark' or 'Obscure' and was reputed to be melancholic. They were linked as a contrasting pair by Seneca, by Juvenal and others. Florentine humanists, to whom such classical texts were well-known used the pair to support the view that a cheerful demeanour was proper to a philosopher.The two philosophers are widely represented in European painting of the Renaissance and Baroque period, either in one picture or as companion pieces.

The canvas in the background can be identified as one from his collection by the artist Armand Guillaumin, with whom Gauguin had painted in the summer of 1881. The mandoline was one of the possessions that he took on all his travels and the vase is very similar to those that Gauguin started to make the following year.At the same time, the work is an exercise in formal arrangement, with the arabesques of the objects on the table being offset by the horizontals and verticals in the background.

The painting is signed and dated 1642 in large letters on the reverse of the canvases and is - together with its pendant in the same collection - the earliest dated works known by the artist.The painting attests to the particular skills of Hiepes in still-life and flower painting, leavened with an ingenuous charm entirely of his own that makes his works among the most appealing of those painted in 17th-century Spain.",https://www.wga.hu/art/h/hiepes/fruitflo.jpg,still-life

A girl is looking at the basket of fruit, its shapes modelled by light, through a window in the background: rarely has seeing been so convincingly painted. The picture of the girl represents not a portrait but a type, a character head. She is painted as a young child expressing her wonder at the world.The true subject of the spiritedly executed canvas is painting itself, its rhythmic line and its open display. The subject has its forerunners in Flemish pantry and kitchen scenes and food still-lifes by artists such as Frans Snyders, Adriaen van Utrecht, Jan Fyt and Pieter Boel; Jan Baptist Weenix would later occupy an important position in the development of the game still-life, and Chardin, too, would draw upon this tradition.",https://www.wga.hu/art/r/rembrand/41misc/08misc.jpg,still-life

Shortly after his return to Holland, he developed his own personal style of painting, rich still-lifes of luxury items - silver cups and dishes, Chinese porcelain vessels and elaborate Venetian-style wine glasses - mysteriously lit, displayed before a dark background, and often placed on an eastern tablecloth. Despite the high quality and luxury status of the objects he rendered, the compositions of those still-lifes are often restricted in their opulence.

These are not far from a game of cards (with a Jack of Spades on top) and a tied-up purse.

It is one of those paintings that mislead the unprepared viewer by displaying the wall on which these objects have been hung. It is likely that the painting was cleverly integrated into the room of a hunting lodge where it was intended to provide amusement to the hunting party. Nowadays we would hardly be deceived by such a painting technique. At the time, however, it was radically new and people's habits of perception had been formed by less illusionist paintings.

_art_k_kalf_stillif.jpg,"This is a typical illustration of the type of still-life of which Kalf was an outstanding specialist. The still-lifes by Kalf look very different from those of his predecessors (like Pieter Claesz. and Willem Heda). They are, in a sense, much more theatrical; in their sonorous quality they bring to mind the landscapes of his contemporary, Jacob van Ruisdael.In the paintings by Heda or Pieter Claesz., the objects are ordered in a simple way; they are just laid out on the table. The light is even; shadows are used only to emphasize each object's plastic form. The still-life is generally set in a rather wide space (the painting itself being oblong). In Kalf's paintings, however, the space is narrowed. The backgrounds is much darker; and in this narrow space, against this background, the still-life seems curiously isolated. A soft light picks out each different object, showing its unique quality and colour, as spotlights focus on actors on a dark stage. In the narrow space, the arrangement too is much tighter.For this rich, glowing kind of still-life the 17th centuy used an apt term, ""pronkstilleven"" (still-life of ostentation); and part of the content of this term is certainly the choice of objects itself. In Heda and Claesz. food and utensils appear that belong to normal life: bread, beer, fish, plates and jugs of pewter or ordinary glass. Kalf (and his contemporary Abraham van Beyeren too) uses almost exclusively objects that are extraordinary: vessels of silver and gold, chalices of china, lobster, tropical fruit, displayed against rich Persian cloth.",https://www.wga.hu/art/k/kalf/stillif.jpg,still-life

The different qualities of silver, gold and pewter, their various degrees of brilliance, hardness and finish have been rendered in painstaking detail. The heavy pewter plates are juxtaposed with an elegant, fine-rimmed silver dish and a golden-lidded chalice bearing a fine statuette of Mars. The blade of the knife at the edge of the table, the dish of hazelnuts, the lid and edge of the brown earthenware jug - all are variations on the artist's theme.The display of foodstuffs seems less impressive at first glance, and arranged almost at random.

According to Palomino he contributed the flower garlands to the work of artists such as Antonio CastrejÃ³n and MatÃ­as de Torres and a large body of his known oeuvre consists of floral and architectural decoration, probably painted to adorn the grand houses of Madrid (which out of context today perhaps no longer retain their original impact and effect).",https://www.wga.hu/art/c/corte/flowers3.jpg,still-life

The instruments are studied under a light that reveals their inner poetry but leaves their age-old shape and substance intact. Lovingly selected, these mandolins and horns are seen in terms of a strict construction of shadowed tones, broken only occasionally by a lighter passage. Their arrangement suggests an illusory, unchanging fixity, as if a symphony had been transposed from sound into three-dimensional composition, after the music had stopped.The instruments represented are a clarinet, a mandolin, a double-bass bow and - on the crest - a recorder.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 12 minutes):Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in G major for two mandolins and orchestra, RV 532 -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bascheni/stillif.jpg,still-life

As most trophy pieces they were designed as representative pictures of the sport, not records of the spoils of a specific hunt.In this picture the painter displayed the finely worked equipment of the huntsman on a marble ledge: a velvet hunting bag with chamois strap, trimmed with gold embroidery and fringes, and a tasseled horn. Above it he suspended the exquisite catch of a fat partridge and three small game birds. The exquisite blue of the velvet contains the expensive pigment lapis lazuli, which yields ultramarine colour when ground. It was imported from China. Van Aelst's lavish use of it reinforces the preciousness of the arrangement and confirms its destination in a wealthy home.

_art_b_barrera_stillife.jpg,"Francisco Barrera became an important figure in the artistic community in Madrid during the 1630s and 1640s, when he took over leadership of the painters' guild. However, he remained a relatively undistinguished master in the panorama of painting at the Spanish court. Like many other painters of limited talents, Barrera was an all-rounder whose production centred on religious subjects, images of saints, landscapes and still-lifes. Like Juan de Arellano, Barrera worked for the open market and sold his paintings from a shop in the centre of Madrid. The rise in popularity of still-life and flower paintings among collectors in Madrid during the middle years of the century doubtlessly encouraged Barrera to turn to this genre. Although his religious paintings are unknown today, his still-life paintings show that he developed a distinct personality in paintings of this type.This painting represents lilies and carnations in an oriental-style vase, the freshness of the lilies denoted by the fact that only five of the blooms have opened. Alongside these, there is a plate of cherries and apricots, that are kept cool by pieces of snow from the wine cooler. The representation on the vase of a monkey picking fruit whimsically relates this object to the fruit collected in the bowl in the picture. A jug of water is placed in the background and in the foreground a pie rests on a napkin, with a knife.The painting typifies Barrera's style in still-life and flower painting. He has sharply defined the forms and details of the flowers, and a certain hardness in their facture reflects the influence of the flower paintings of Juan van der Hamen and Antonio Ponce, the latter working with Barrera on decorative painting projects at the Buen Retiro in the 1630s.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431 -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/barrera/stillife.jpg,still-life

Such plunderings from non-Western sources was later to become commonplace in Gauguin's work, when he used them deliberately to attempt to create a 'primitive' flavour.

It is a term that could be translated as 'ostentatious still-life'. These still-lifes displayed an array of luxurious possessions that reflected the lifestyle of the wealthy in seventeenth century Holland. Venetian glass, Chinese porcelain and Turkish carpets bedecked with ornamental gold and silverware were painted as status symbols, to be hung in the homes of the affluent patrons who commissioned them. However the choice of objects was not always for spectacle alone as they sometimes carried a symbolic significance. Although only the rich could afford such rare artefacts, which were usually imported from distant lands, their inclusion in a painting could be interpreted as a patriotic tribute to the prosperity of Dutch trade. The inclusion of citrus fruits alongside wine is often read as encouraging moderation in the use of alcohol, as lemon juice was added to wine to reduce its potency and for medicinal effect.The painting is signed lower left: J. van.

Although this is a so-called breakfast still-life (an onbijtje), hardly any food is shown, but only the sparse left-overs of a meal, such as the olive on the plate, where it forms some kind of optical barrier between the hollow foot of the goblet and the plate that reflects it.

_art_m_melendez_stillfig.jpg,"In 1753, after four years in the Eternal City, MelÃ©ndez was recalled by his father to assist with a prestigious commission from Ferdinand VI to illuminate a new set of choir books for the Royal Chapel, to replace those lost in the fire of the AlcÃ¡zar in 1734. Despite the high acclaim which his illuminations (which show early signs of his skilful depiction of inanimate objects) received at court, Luis' subsequent four petitions to be appointed royal painter were declined by Charles III. It seems likely that MelÃ©ndez's archaic miniaturist style and lack of experience beyond that specialised work counted against him, at a time when the royal court required artists adept in producing large-scale works in fresco and canvas (such as Corrado Giaquinto) to decorate the new Palacio Real, as well as proven portrait painters to promote the recent accesion of Charles III in 1759. On completion of his royal illuminations it appears that MelÃ©ndez received no further commissions at court and as a result the artist began to turn in desperation to the subject which ironically would earn him enduring international fame - still-life painting.It is no co-incidence therefore that the artist's earliest known still-lifes date from around 1759-60. Despite the important tradition of still-life painting during the Spanish Golden Age, the genre had dramatically declined by the second half of the 18th century, with none of the court painters being regular practicioners of the art. For MelÃ©ndez, still-lifes were a relatively easy commodity to sell, and would typically have been painted on speculation of finding a buyer (rather than on commission). It seems that during the 1760s and 1770s he largely cornered the market in Madrid, being the only significant still-life painter working there at that time.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/melendez/stillfig.jpg,still-life

_art_s_stoskopf_stillife.jpg,"The most neglected area of French 17th-century painting is that of still-life. It is still sometimes mistakenly assumed that the work of still-life painters was insignificant in their time compared with the grand designs of Claude and Poussin but, with one major exception, all the main still-life painters worked in Paris; they were not provincial artists working in obscurity away from the mainstream of the development of painting.The exception was the obscure SÃ©bastian Stoskopff, whose oeuvre has only recently been reconstructed. He was isolated in Strasbourg, the main town of the province of Alsace, which did not come under French rule until 1648 (although Strasbourg itself was not occupied until 1681). In the Middle Ages the artistic traditions of Alsace had their own flavour, being subjected to influences from central Europe, Italy, and, to a lesser extent, France. Stoskopff, however, was influenced by none of these traditions, being a totally isolated painter working in a style verging on the naive. Influences from such German still-life painters as Georg Flegel are discernible, but they merely be caused by the similarity of subject-matter rather than by any stylistic affinity.Stoskopff art's is unique. One of the best examples of his work is the Still-Life of Glasses in a Basket. The tonality is monochrome, and the glasses in the basket are positioned in disarray. To this day, waitresses in restaurants in the region collect the empty drinking glasses by placing them heaped up in a basket rather than balancing them on a tray.

_art_p_pensiona_stillife.jpg,"When he published this painting at the end of the 1920s,  Roberto Longhi described it as an 'Unfinished meal - the carafe half-emptied, the melon and the water melon cut, the pear intact and the apple cut, and the flies jumping on their own shadows'. Longhi was at this time just beginning his research into Caravaggio and, in his view, the painting, which is impressive but really only of medium size, was by Caravaggio. Who else could have painted a masterpiece of such intensity and of such compositional excellence?Caravaggio's paternity in this case, however, was quite short-lived. By the 1950s the work had been attributed to an anonymous artist close to Carlo Saraceni named 'Pensionante del Saraceni'. Agreement on this attribution was almost unanimous, but it has not yet to a precise identification of the artist. His probable French nationality and his first-hand knowledge of Caravaggio appear to be the only secure information we have about him. The group of works attributed to him is tiny and the Washington painting is his only true still-life.In this still-life the table is covered with a silken cloth on which are placed a pear, a monumental slice of water melon, a melon, a plate of fruit and a glass carafe half full of white wine. Two flies buzz at a distance, but they could easily jump onto these recently abandoned leftovers. The dark background is one of the walls of a room, not just a backdrop as it is in the more or less contemporaneous painting in Rome attributed to the Master of the Hartford Still-life. In Pensionante's picture the few pieces of fruit and the splendid carafe reflecting the light possess an extraordinary presence. The soft, almost velvety light is unlike that in Caravaggio's youthful works.

_art_b_bascheni_stillins.jpg,"The art of Baschenis represents a peculiar chapter in the development of Italian still-life painting: through it the Bergamo School suddenly became famous, and since he had many followers and pupils, the genre of still-life painting with instruments became widely practiced. His large ceremonial compositions are his most characteristic and best works. The moderate and cheerful realism of his style was inspired by Caravaggio, but it remained free of the soul-searching dilemma encountered by the painters of seventeenth-century Rome, Naples and Florence. In his choice of themes and objects he was probably influenced by the world-famous instrument-making shop at nearby Cremona, which, for example, produced the beautiful lutes and violins of the Amati family.In Baschenis's paintings the instruments are the mediums of the Vanitas idea, and they are seldom coupled with the more expressive images of skulls, candles or books. In themselves a violin with its strings broken or a dusty lute are symbols of mortality. In this painting a single flower accentuates the meaning, and the presence of the globe makes it universally valid. Even the jewel-inlaid ebony writing desk is not merely decorative counterpoint in the red-gold-blue-green-brown harmony; rather it invokes the vanity of sciences as well. The two lutes laid down across each other and the violin rendered in side-view reveal the painter's excellent knowledge of the instruments' anatomy.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Lodovico Viadana: La Bergamasca -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bascheni/stillins.jpg,still-life

Heda was one of the best painters of still-lifes of serving tables and food, to which he gives a monumental feel and at the same time a certain compositional restraint, which suggests to us that we should apply a similar restraint towards our consumption of the food.Heda's style is characterized by its use of a monochromatic palette of green, grey and silvery tones. His compositions are balanced and never overcrowded, depicting a tabletop on which various items of food, objects and luxurious vessels are casually but carefully arranged.

The base of the composition is formed by a Wanli egg-shell china bowl with fruits. We can make out an orange, a half peeled lemon, apricots, white and purple grapes, medlars and plums. To the right a lobster, flanked by peaches and apricots on a raw wood box. To the left a simple round box serves as a base for a half filled rummer. The presence of an elegant fluted glass, providing the top of the composition, is indicated solely by the light reflected on the narrow top. A third, bowl-shaped glass stands - scarcely visible - between the fluted glass and the lobster. A small collection of flowers - roses, a carnation, violets - forms a colourful point of light and a visual counterweight to the dominating red lobster to the left of the bowl. The visual gaps are filled and a lighter accent is added with smaller fruit, creepers, twigs, blades and insects: we see blackberries, medlars, hazelnuts, acorns, cherries, a bumble bee, caterpillars, butterflies and a dragonfly.In the composition a number of ovals are enclosed in a triangle, which in turn is literally rounded off by the arch of the niche. A large diagonal traverses the whole ensemble, ending on the lower left on the lid of the reed basket. To the right of it, vine tendrils curl over the edge of a copper wine cooler.For more than a hundred years this work of art was catalogued as being by Jan Davidsz. de Heem.

_art_u_utrecht_stillife.jpg,"This painting is one of a group of paintings that Van Utrecht produced in this form, beginning in the early 1640s, under the influence of small-format hunting pieces by Jan Fyt. A dead hare lies on a tabletop parallel to the painting's lower edge with its back legs trussed together, with a number of birds around an inverted wicker basket. An arrangement of vegetables, comprising a melon, cabbages and globe artichokes, balances them on the right-hand side. Suspended above the two groups is a ring hook, such is used for hanging game, to which five birds of differing sizes have been attached. A light source presumably located outside the painting to the left casts a strong narrow shaft of light onto the arrangement from the side. Some areas, such as the small birds skewered together on the rod at the front, remain in shadow. A softer light falls from the opposite side, a device that the painter used regularly to give body to the forms in his still-lifes.The individual motifs in the painting demonstrate a precise knowledge of the creatures depicted, which interestingly consist solely of small game. A wild duck, hanging by one leg in a dominant central position, is framed by two kingfishers, a sparrow and a blackbird, all attached to the ring. The hare lying head down on the tabletop echoes the bird's vertical lines in its outstretched body and continues them in its two front legs hanging down at the front. Two dead snipe have been placed decoratively, although in a strange position, beside the hare, while a partridge leans against a basket. A bullfinch, a goldfinch, and a variety of other finches have been skewered on a rod that projects from the table, a visual idea that is echoed by the artichokes on the other side.Adriaen van Utrecht drew inspiration in terms of both form and content from Frans Snyders, whose still-lifes with game and fowl1 contain a number of comparable motifs. But the precision in Van Utrecht's painting, his constant attention to detail, and his controlled use of colour, centring chiefly on a cool grey with shades of brown, green and violet, is stylistically much closer to Jan Fyt.",https://www.wga.hu/art/u/utrecht/stillife.jpg,still-life
_art_k_kalf_nautilux.jpg,"Kalf depicted decorative objects - such as Chinese porcelain soup tureens, preciously decorated nautilus goblets and costly carpets - his paintings seem to have been dominated not so much by wealth and prosperity as by the aesthetic values and optical qualities of perception that emanated from these objects. Thus, the refraction of the light on the objects and the modification of the colours as mirrored by each of the other objects become the real subject of his art. Kalf achieved his effects by giving objects a bright luminescence, further emphasized by a dark background a method which made him a remote kinsman of the Caravaggists. His objects only exist to the extent that they can be perceived, but in order to be perceived they need light to dispel that darkness which is the original state of the world.However, unlike Caravaggio and his successors, Kalf avoided beaming any harsh shafts of light onto an object. Instead, his light is more subdued and diffuse, with a source that cannot be exactly identified (though it usually comes from above). It gives each object a minimum of brightness so that it shines faintly and transparently from within here and there, for example on the edge of a silver bowl, although there are also brightly shining spots in some places. The light dissolves, as it were, the material properties of the objects: delicately thin Chinese porcelain is perceived as fragile, brittle and transparent, penetrated softly by the light. Half-peeled oranges and lemons, with their skins spiralling down artistically, have their fruity flesh displayed in such a way that their drop-like fibres flicker golden in the light.",https://www.wga.hu/art/k/kalf/nautilux.jpg,still-life

_art_d_delacroi_2_201delac.jpg,"This painting, painted at Beffes for General Coetlosquet, was one of the splendid collection of works which Delacroix sent to the Salon of 1827, and which included the Death of Sardanapalus as well as others from among his finest pictures. On 28 September 1827, Delacroix wrote to his friend Soulier: 'I have finished the General's animal picture, and I have dug up a rococo frame for it, which I have had regilded and which will do for it splendidly. It has already dazzled people at a gathering of amateurs, and I think it would be amusing to see it in the Salon.'Of all Delacroix's paintings, the Still-Life with Lobster reveals most clearly the impression made on the young artist by English painting. The background with its red-coated huntsmen is reminiscent of landscapes by Constable; the dead game in the foreground, and the incongruous lobster, rival the finest details in the works of Jan Fyt.Delacroix painted this picture when he returned from England; even before then, he was in close touch with English painters in Paris - Fielding and Bonington amongst others. But it was at the Salon of 1824 that he discovered the revolution which Constable had brought about in English painting, when he saw the three landscapes which the latter was exhibiting there. He hastily repainted the background of the Massacre of Scio along much the same lines; when the state bought the picture from him for 6,000 francs (a considerable sum in those days) he lost no time in spending the money on a trip to England. This opened up a new world to him: the Parthenon marbles, the Gothic style, the paintings of Lawrence and Etty, the horses (his host was the horsedealer Elmore), sailing in a yacht - a sport he was able to indulge in with an aristocratic friend of Elmore's - and the plays of Shakespeare. English painting had attracted a whole colony of French artists to London; among them EugÃ¨ne Isabey, EugÃ¨ne Lami, and Henri Monnier. Delacroix also renewed contact with Bonington, and worked in company with him.

Unlike van Beijeren, however, de Heem's art scintillates with bright colours and an unsurpassable  attention to detail. Influenced by the Jesuit artist Daniel Seghers, de Heem frequently incorporated hidden religious symbolism in his paintings. In this still-life, for example, the mussel and the lobster are allusions to the resurrection, and are related to the 'Eucharistic' grapes.",https://www.wga.hu/art/h/heem/jan/2/stillobs.jpg,still-life

Like the botanical gardens and finest collections, still-lifes gathered disparate objects from all reaches of Dutch trade, and brought them home, re-presenting them in European terms of science and collecting, without specific concern about their origin. In this painting of fine household items, Willem Kalf effortlessly combined Venetian and Dutch glassware, a recently made Chinese jar for luxury ginger, a Dutch silver dish, a Mediterranean peach, and a half-peeled lemon, the object of citrus trade and of medicinal treatises. He displayed them on an Indian floral carpet, in a dramatic spotlight that invites contemplation and admiration, for the fine wares as well as the artist's recrafting of them.

_art_s_snyders_2_still_li.jpg,"Just as a circle of specialists for individual genres gathered in Amsterdam around Rembrandt, the same was true in Antwerp around Rubens. Snyders frequently collaborated with him on arrangements of objects and staffage. On the other hand, Snyders also adopted Rubens' new Baroque principles into his own specialized area of still life. The result was a number of new pictorial types in this field.He initially drew upon the great kitchen interiors and pantry paintings of the Flemish Mannerists such as Aertsen or Beuckelaer. However, whereas these artists created ""epic"" arrangements of enormous breadth, Snyders sought to produce more dynamic still-lifes. He created the hunting still-life which not only features game, but also includes certain elements of the hunt itself, and in which each animal, dead or alive, still has its own tale to tell. In his portrayal of animals, he was peerless in his time. Whereas Dutch still-life presented coded ""truths"" and warned of the transience of earthly life, Snyders staged a theatrical drama portraying the riches of the world.

_art_g_gijsbrec_francisc_vanitas.jpg,"Many Flemish still-lifes refer in all their beauty to the transience of life but it was Franciscus Gijsbrechts who expressed this transience in the most explicit fashion. His Vanitas is conceived as a grandiose spectacle dealing with the vanity of the intellectual world (globe, books), of the 'vita voluptaria' (musical instruments, smoking implements) and, finally, of the transience of life (skull, hourglass). The moralistic meaning of these still-lifes might have lost some of its urgency as far as modern viewers are concerned, but the visual pleasure which they offer is an equally important aspect.There are similarities between Franciscus Gijsbrecht and Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts, both in their choice of motif and in the range of objects portrayed. But while Cornelis Norbertus quite quickly specialised into trompe l'oeil still-lifes, Franciscus painted mostly Vanitas still-lifes.To a certain extant Franciscus painted the same accessories as Cornelis Norbertus, but typical of Franciscus are the costlier jugs and dishes, the table cloths with long fringes, the large musical instruments, draped cloths and finally the large bundles of crumpled landscape prints of drawings or unspecified papers, heavily dog-eared and overhanging the edge of a table or niche.",https://www.wga.hu/art/g/gijsbrec/francisc/vanitas.jpg,still-life

_art_b_bascheni_stillmus.jpg,"Because he was in holy orders, Baschenis is sometimes referred to as Father Evaristo. The Bergamese Baschenis was, more than anything else, the perfect example of a ""specialist"" painter. In fact nearly all his oeuvre was dedicated to painting musical instruments, sometimes his pictures being finished by other painters who added figures (as in the case of two paintings that have recently been found in the Brera in Milan). From this specific point of view, Baschenis is one of the most fascinating and focused painters of the whole of the seventeenth century. His use of realism and light is reminiscent of Caravaggio. His canvases had an intense quality which was dominated by his exceptional technical ability (one thing that stands out is the way in which he depicted dust on the back of stringed instruments).But Baschenis' work never degenerated into a mere display of virtuoso talent. It was rather directed to convey a sense of almost severe moral purpose. Baschenis' success with still-life gave rise, especially in Bergamo itself, to a real fashion for the genre, with other painters following his example.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Francesco da Milano: Tre fantasie for lute -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bascheni/stillmus.jpg,still-life

In 1728 he was accepted as a painter of animals and fruit at the Paris Academy of Art without having to fulfil the usual requirements.The structure of this painting is simpler than in his earlier still-lifes, and Chardin has reduced the number of objects to a minimum. By singling out and thus monumentalizing the motif of the bird, Chardin gives it considerably more emphasis. According to the categories of feudal game law, the pheasant was seen as reserved for the nobility, but the hunting trophy which has been attached to the pheasant has, from a bourgeois point of view, lost its value of triumphantly demonstrating man's lordship over nature. However, the way in which the pheasant is rendered does not indicate in any way that colour is gradually becoming detached from the object. Rather, the careful, delicate application of the paint - even in the more roughened structures - heightens the element of sensitive empathy. Unlike the game still-lifes of his contemporaries - which have a smooth, cold objectiveness about them - the artist has created an atmosphere of intimacy between the viewer and the object.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Joseph Haydn: The Seasons, Part 3 Autumn, aria and chorus (Hunters' chorus) -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/c/chardin/2/09deadph.jpg,still-life

_art_m_mignon_still_3.jpg,"This painting is a variation on the artist's style as seen in his other works. However, the individual objects are no longer scattered across the forest ground but are grouped together in an arched niche, to form a fruit-basket motif that resembles the display of a harvest festival.The painting contains both Eucharistic symbols and an element of transience, indicated by the small number of rotten spots of the fruit, as well as the presence of a clock, and the dualism of good and evil. The two rather cute little animals, a squirrel and a goldfinch, are also in opposition to each other. The squirrel seems to be chained up, but on closer inspection we notice that it has managed to free itself. It has cracked open a walnut and is now eating its kernel. The squirrel had been regarded as a symbol of the evil since the Middle Ages. In this painting it embodies the unleashing of evil in the form of harmlessness. The bell collar around its neck also identifies it as a 'fool' and thus a sinner. The meaning of a squirrel eating walnut becomes obvious when we consider that St Augustine saw the walnut as a symbol of Christ, with the shell as the wood of the cross and the kernel as the life-giving nature of Christ.Unlike the squirrel, the goldfinch is a christological symbol, particularly with reference to the Passion. Its positive meaning can be gathered from its position in the upper portion of the painting (top=sphere of salvation). The actions of the bird are worth nothing. Chained to an arched semicircle, from which it can peck food out of a small container, it is pulling up a thimble-sized receptacle from the left-hand edge of the shelf. It is filled with water or - more likely - wine (as a Eucharistic symbol of the blood of Christ), which has been scooped out of a conical glass without stem or base.",https://www.wga.hu/art/m/mignon/still_3.jpg,still-life

_art_b_bruegel_jan_e_flowers_goldenta.jpg,"Jan Brueghel the Elder, the youngest son of the world-famous painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder and court painter to the Archdukes Albrecht and Isabella, truly merited his nickname of ""Velvet Brueghel"". The precision and virtuosity of his still-lifes are superbly illustrated by the present work with its striking and radiant enamel-like colours. This extremely elegant little panel, whichexists in several versions, can probably be counted as one of the jewels of 17th century painting. Against a chased silver-gilt tazza or drinking bowl leans a wreath of spring and summer flowers, made up of carnations, roses, anemones, periwinkles, turban buttercups, lilies of the valley, forget-me-nots and hawthorns, as well as tulips and African marigolds, newly introduced into the Netherlands.From his correspondence we know that Jan Brueghel worked mostly from nature and that such compositions cost him a great deal of effort, because of his concern to execute them with such precision and devotion. On the table lies a jewel box containing a gold ring, coins, a pearl necklace and two identical golden bracelets set with agates. In those days women mostly wore the same bracelets on both wrists. Alongside the box we can make out another three rings set with diamonds, and a pendant with enamel insets, precious stones and tear-shaped pearls. The golden pearl hairpin to the left of the tazza is an ornament that appears only in the Netherlands in the first half of the 17th century. In most cases this pin is placed in the hair next to the head covering. On the marriage day it changes side from left to right, or right to left, depending on the region. The presence of the hairpin and the pearl necklace, pointing to the immaculate marital morality of the wearer, suggests that the panel can perhaps be interpreted as an allegory of marriage.An innovative feature in this still-life is the use of diagonals. Not only the wreath, but also the jewels and the jewel case lie obliquely on the table, in order to produce a stronger effect of depth. Here wealth symbolises beauty. Both the flowers and the jewels stand out brightly against the neutral background. Brueghel paints with equal affection the humble white carnation and the baroque pendant next to it.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker, ballet suite, op. 71, Waltz of the Flowers -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bruegel/jan_e/flowers/goldenta.jpg,still-life

A wide variety of surfaces, each with a different effect in light, with pure or iridescent colours, is spread out before us. Yet snails are already crawling across the vine leaves, the foliage is discoloured and withering and, the ears of grain are curling, the peach has burst its skin, the citrus fruit is half peeled, the white carnation is dried and drooping over the table edge.At the very point where the image bears an iconographic message of the transience of worldly life in the form of nature's riches, we see these things in their last bloom of beauty.

The objects are put on a table, but the table is placed against a plain background which is strangely transparent with dull light. The still-life almost seems to float, like the mirage of trees on the still, reflective water in the river landscapes of Salomon van Ruysdael.

However, van der Hamen's use of this scheme differs from that of the Roman painters, who liked to scatter a profusion of  inanimate objects over the surface. Van der Hamen drastically reduces the number of elements and arranges the remainder into exquisitely balanced, asymmetrical compositions, strongly lit in the Spanish manner.

_art_b_bascheni_stillife.jpg,"Baschenis, an artist from Bergamo, was a highly specialized painter who worked almost exclusively on the portrayal of stringed instruments. The nearby town of Cremona, a famous centre of violin and lute making, provided him with his models. However, unlike the Netherlandish artists, who often used musical instruments as symbols of hearing, while the transience of the notes recalled the transience of life, Baschenis does not paint scenes of allegorical or moral significance. His emphasis lies on the aesthetic and decorative aspects, as reflected in his singular attention to painterly and ornamental detail in portraying these instruments.A theorbo, a tenor lute and a descant lute, as well as a violin with bow can be seen together with a writing box, a quill and a book of music set on a table against which a cello is leaning. A mysterious life develops between these objects. The mild sheen on the surface of the woods and the changing hues on the body of the lute create a visual autonomy that almost makes us forget the actual purpose of these instruments. Their curves present unusual viewpoints as though by chance. These musical objects are an almost tangible feast of tranquillity for the eyes.<!-- Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 14 minutes):George Frideric Handel: Concerto for harp, lute and theorbo in B flat major -->",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bascheni/stillife.jpg,still-life

_art_b_boelema_stillife.jpg,"A ""tiny banquet"" or ""small breakfast"" is best seen as the sober counterpart to the ostentatious Dutch 17th century still-lifes. The number of objects portrayed is limited, the colour palette muted: black, white, grey and brown in every shade define the atmosphere. Connoisseurs frequently deprecate Maerten Boelema de Stomme's often slightly out-of balance and over-busy compositions, with objects piled one on top of another. However, this painting is repeatedly cited as a time when Boelema de Stomme equals his teacher Heda.A round, voluminous object in the form of a bearded man's crock placed in a diagonal beam of light is chosen to form the centre of a composition which seeks to perform a dangerous balancing act, its excess weight having to be neutralised over the rest of the painting. A second eye-catching item, a precious nautilus beaker, is placed on the one visible corner of the table, reflecting the white of the table cloth and standing out starkly against the dark, neutral background of the upper right-hand corner. The oval and circular shapes of the plates with simple foodstuffs echo and inter-link the shapes of the main objects. A fluted glass, flanked to the right by a step glass, provide the top of a triangle in the composition. The salt cellar and an overturned berkemeier wineglass fill the lower left corner of the tableau.A second connecting line runs between three objects: a knife with a blocked handle, to the left on a plate, refers to its dark black knife-case, the down-hanging top of which counterbalances the upward movement of the fluted glass. Only an opened walnut and hazelnut, close to the pealed lemon, suggest that the laid table has already been touched. The nuts strewn between the other objects produce a concentration of smaller ovals that attract the viewer's eyes as to the centre of a whirlpool: the nuts themselves, the opening of the crock, its cover, the surface of the cut-open fruit, the wire foot and the thorn knobs on the wineglass, the ball-feet of the salt cellar.The artist sparingly distributes a few yellow colour accents over the picture surface in the lemons and the bread roll.

In still-lifes he could explore ways of establishing visual harmony and three-dimensionality more thoroughly.In the latter half of the 1890s CÃ©zanne increasingly did more opulent, spatially more dynamic, indeed baroque compositions. These pictures are far removed from the straight representation of a laid table. No one would pile crockery, fruit, a brocade drape and a crumpled tablecloth on a chest in this way.

The knife in the foreground, still largely the only piece of cutlery at the time, was shared by all the participant of the feast. The dragonfly and the butterfly add an emblematic dimension to this everyday motif. The artist shows the forces of good and evil fighting for man's soul in the form of animals. The human soul is represented by strawberries and cherries, which were considered to be fruits of Paradise.

He knew the habits of these creatures very well and is known to have bred snakes, lizards and insects himself.

On the ledge there are two  small clay pipes. The inscription on the sheet of music under the glass reads: 'That which exists out of measure perishes in evil immeasurably'. To the initiated, the implication is clear. Overindulgence in drinking or smoking tobacco (an intoxicant recently introduced from the New World) should be curbed.

The first known French works are dated from the 1620s and were popular among scholars who considered these paintings as worthy of display in cabinets of curiosities.The present still-life adapts the subject of a simple basket filled with damson plums arranged frontally on a table. The rigorous composition is pure and balanced. The composition is staged against a dark background highlighting the Caravaggesque theatrical effect. The table's edge is part of the composition. It is visible throughout the length of the panel and is described with great realism. The light projects from beyond the frame and from the left.

Most people would rather study a picture of an exquisitely laid table than one of a mess of fish. But van Beyeren's celebrations of the abundance of the sea are as remarkable as his festive dinner tables. In them he sometimes includes a glimpse of a beach in the background. The fish and crustacea he painted always look wet - they appear to have been just taken from the water - and the mother-of pearl greys of his creatures of the sea, their browns, silvers, and white are as delicate and finely felt as the colour accords in his more showy pieces.",https://www.wga.hu/art/b/beyeren/still_fi.jpg,still-life

They testified several times together as witnesses in lawsuits. They produced ten collaborative paintings, dating between 1644 and 1653.

_art_p_poorter_stillife.jpg,"It can hardly be a coincidence that armour and weapons often occur in still-lifes painted during the Thirty Years' War. This war, which caused unimaginable suffering, was originally started by the Spanish-Austrian House of Habsburg together with the League of the Roman Catholic Estates of the Empire. They were committed to the Counter-Reformation and wanted to re-catholicize the rebellious Republic of the United Netherlands after it had become independent in 1609, and in particular to conquer the economic resources of this wealthy country. Subsequently, however, the war spread more an more widely, with the involvement of an increasing number of countries. Dragging on interminably, the final phase was marked by soldiers pillaging, looting and brutally exploiting the civilian population.This is the background of paintings like Poorter's still-life. Painted in 1636, it provides an emblematic, impressionist commentary on the war. In 1634 the Imperial troops had gained a victory at NÃ¶rdlingen, so that the situation changed in favour of the League. This may well explain the ""vanitas"" character of the painting, expressed in the skull and the sarcophagus behind the banner which divides the picture diagonally into two parts. Thus, the victories of the other side are made to seem bearable, as they are mere vanity in the face of eternity.

The elegant motif of the tall glass containing a single sprig of orange blossom is reminiscent of the small glass vessels with flowers that appear in the works of CamprobÃ­n. However, a number of stylistic features of the painting suggest that Juan de ZurbarÃ¡n may be its author and it perhaps dates the from the early years of his short career, when an admiration for the style of his father prevailed.The appeal of the painting lies in the exquisite simplicity of the artist's presentation of the modest subject matter, a plate of red and gold apples on a silver plate and a single flower in a glass.

_art_h_heda_goblet.jpg,"The work of the Dutch still-life painters who appear around 1620 corresponds to the tonal trend of the landscapists of van Goyen's generation. Pieter Claesz and Willem Claesz. Heda, popularizers of the breakfast piece, are the principal representatives of this phase. Claesz, the father of the landscapist Nicolaes Berchem, was born at Berchem (probably the village near Antwerp). Heda's origins are obscure. Both were primarily active at Haarlem and underwent similar stylistic developments.Their early works show the influence of the older still-life painters, but they soon limited themselves to the description of a simple meal set near the corner of a table - some bread and cheese, a herring on a pewter dish, a glass of beer or wine, perhaps a silvery pewter vessel, and a white crumpled tablecloth - just enough to suggest a light breakfast or snack. These objects, which always look as if they had been touched by someone who is still close by, are no longer treated as isolated entities: they are grouped together, forming masses along a single diagonal axis. But more important, Pieter Claesz and Heda reacted to the comprehensive forces of light and atmosphere which envelop us and the things with which we live, and they found means to express their reactions to these forces as accurately, immediately, and intensely as possible. As a result, they seem to animate their simple subjects. With a new pictorial mode, they achieve a more dynamic spatial and compositional treatment.The foreground of their unpretentious arrangements becomes spacious, and there is clear recession. Instead of vivid local colours, monochromatic harmonies with sensitive contrasts of valeurs of low intensity are favoured, without, however, a loss of the earlier regard for textural differentiation. From the point of view of composition and of colouristic, tonal, and spatial treatment the perfectly balanced still-lifes by Claesz and Heda are among the most satisfying Dutch paintings made during the century.Claesz has a more vigorous touch than Heda. He was also a man of simpler tastes. Heda depicts oysters more frequently than herrings, and after 1640 his compositions became larger, richer, and more decorative. To obtain a more monumental effect, during his maturity Heda often abandons the traditional horizontal format for a vertical one. Ornate silver vessels and costly 'faÃ§on de Venise' glasses, at the time blown in the Netherlands as well as Venice, intensify the contrasts of valeurs, and touches of colour provided by the pink of sliced hams and ripe fruit are combined with an increased chiaroscuro.",https://www.wga.hu/art/h/heda/goblet.jpg,still-life

Parallel to the picture plane, a smooth frame delineates the opening for a window. From the direction of the spectator, light falls upon the parapet, on which the slice of melon and the cucumber are placed so that they jut over slightly and thereby they seem to be almost within reach - a trompe l'oeil effect that was particularly popular in Netherlandish painting in the 17th century. The head of cabbage and the quince, suspended on threads that presumably have been attached to the upper frame, are dangling over the gaping darkness.Even if the objects are arranged so that they seem close enough to touch, they are nevertheless distanced. For all the naturalism with which they are depicted, the isolation of each object, heightened further by the black background, makes each of them seem extremely artificial and lends them a monumental, almost sculptural gravity. The centre of the picture is empty and the arrangement seems coincidental; the dimension of the painted picture is denied.

_art_f_flegel_breadcon.jpg,"In the culinary culture of the aristocracy and the patrician middle classes, banquets consisted of six to eight - sometimes even nine - courses and were always concluded by a dessert. Interest in desserts came to a climax at a time when numerous delicacies had been introduced as new luxuries. This was especially true for sugar confectionary, which appeared in still-lifes around 1600 for the first time. The introduction of sugar marked a radical revolution of taste. Initially it was only used for pharmaceutical purposes, but it soon replaced honey as a sweetener and a food.The crystalline structure of the candied sugar was rendered especially accurately by Georg Flegel in his confectionary still-life. His painting shows candied fruit on a table in the foreground, including two figs on the right, encrusted with large sugar crystals. Some of the fruits have been cut up in the shape of letters, for example a large 'O' can be made out as well as a crumbled 'A' beside the loaf of bread. A straight piece of sugar is lying across the loaf like a cross-beam and is being approached by a disproportionately large bee. The earthenware bowl with the blue pattern contains candied fruit dusted with icing sugar, and a brimstone butterfly, whose wings also show traces of sugar, has alighted on it.Flegel added a religious dimension, because the seemingly innocuous arrangement is full of Christian allusions. For example, the letters 'A' and 'O' (Alpha and Omega) as the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet are a reference to Apocalypse 1:8 and 21:6, where Christ is referred to as the beginning and the end. The cross formed by the loaf and the piece of sugar emphasizes this aspect even further. Finally, as a reminder of the Eucharist, there is the bread and wine in the dainty glass, with decorations resembling amphora handles which drop down in the form of grape-like clusters at the bottom. The redemptive work of Christ is called to mind by the butterfly, an ancient symbol of the human soul as well of the resurrection, as new life comes forth from a seemingly dead chrysalis. The heart on the right is a specially shaped piece of bread, made from communion wafer dough, and is apparently meant to remind the viewer of the heart of Christ.In Flegel's art, sugar has entirely taken over the religious connotations of honey, which was understood as a symbol of 'spiritual sweetness' during the Middle ages.",https://www.wga.hu/art/f/flegel/breadcon.jpg,still-life

_art_k_kessel_jan1_stil_lif.jpg,"This Flemish artist's teacher and uncle was Jan Brueghel the Younger, and therefore he was a direct descendant on his mother's side from Pieter the Elder and Jan the Elder. He painted chiefly still-lifes, frequently representing food laid out sumptuously on light-coloured tables and depicted with the delicacy of a miniaturist, using lively colours of a predominately red tint laid on with the tip of the brush.The documentary, informative, educational, and communicative function of these richly laid tables, in which the individual objects are simply added on and depicted from a slightly raised viewpoint, is combined with the evident intention of demonstrating the affluence of the wealthy patrons of these works. It is also possible to discern allegorical intentions alluding to the five senses or the four elements, but while such an interpretation is quite plausible, the principal aim is a purely aesthetic one, offering this profusion of beautiful objects, rendered with exquisite skill, as a simple feast for the eyes.There is a companion piece to this painting, a variation on the same theme, also on show in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.",https://www.wga.hu/art/k/kessel/jan1/stil_lif.jpg,still-life
_art_m_master_zunk_sp_zunk_sp4_stillif2.jpg,"This painting and its pair, Still-Life with a Bowl of Grapes, are undoubtedly Spanish, though they also show an influence by the early 17th century Roman painters.

_art_r_ruysdael_salomon_2_stil_tur.jpg,"Salomon van Ruysdael, who was a few years younger than van Goyen, shares with him the fame of tonal landscape in Holland, though he moved more slowly and differed considerable from van Goyen's vivacious temperament. In his landscape production he is less versatile and more uniform than van Goyen, although for a while, and rather late in his career, (from about 1659 to 1662) he tried his hand at a different subject matter, painting some still-lifes and hunting trophies.In his still-lifes Ruysdael always represented objects set on a marble tabletop. Probably he painted the artificial marble he had invented, which, according to Houbraken could not be distinguished from the real thing.",https://www.wga.hu/art/r/ruysdael/salomon/2/stil_tur.jpg,still-life
_art_k_kalf_nautilus.jpg,"One of the most characteristic types of painting in Holland in the seventeenth century was still-life which was brought to a higher level of refinement there than anywhere else in Europe. Some still-lifes have symbolic meanings - the vanity of earthly wealth - but others, including those of the greatest practitioner of this genre, Willem Kalf, seem to be simply pronkstilleven, lavish displays of ceramics, glassware, gold and silver vessels as well as exotic food. They reflect a new willingness of rich Dutchmen to parade their possessions, an attitude which would have been frowned upon by an earlier, more puritanical generation.Kalf was born in Rotterdam and probably trained in the studio of FranÃ§ois Ryckhals in Middelburg, a town with a long established tradition of still-life painting. Subsequently he lived for some years in Paris where he met Flemish still-life artists, whose painterly style softened the linearity of Kalf's earliest manner. Kalf returned to Rotterdam but settled in Amsterdam in 1653 with his wife Cornelia Pluvier, a distinguished glassengraver, poetess and musician. In the following year Kalf was praised by the poet Jan Vos as one of the city's leading painters: he was much sought after by prosperous citizens anxious to record their treasures. This particular painting includes a richly decorated nautilus cup and a Wan-Li bowl, which were no doubt prized possessions of the unknown Amsterdammer who commissioned the still-life.",https://www.wga.hu/art/k/kalf/nautilus.jpg,still-life

_art_a_ast_apple.jpg,"Still-life paintings were popular in Dutch art and began to emerge as a genre in their own right during the 16th century.
